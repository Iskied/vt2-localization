I want a word with you. That repair job you did on the drawbridge...","nik_keep_idle_23":"See, I quite like this place, but the acoustics do... amplify... singing.

This is more like it.","nik_keep_idle_08":"Managed to get some fresh supplies in. Do me a favour, and drink the beer in moderation. We don't want a repeat of last time.","nik_loading_screen_farmland_02":"I've had reports of Rotblood foraging parties in the vicinity of Ussingen. Now, that's bad enough, but it turns out some folk were too stubborn to show a clean pair of heels when it all went south.

Make your way to Morgensloft farm and save as many as you can.","nik_loading_screen_skittergate_01":"The time has come, people. The Skittergate guards have been thinned, the Rotblood forces lack leadership and dear old Rasknitt is off to hold some self-congratulatory victory speech. This is our chance to destroy the Skittergate. Now, just let me finish before you start screaming bloody murder... You must go through the Skittergate and travel to Norsca. It's the only way.

It'll get you into your chosen Weave. And back out again. I hope.","nik_loading_screen_skittergate_02":"Time's arrived to shut that bloody skittergate down for good. Rasknitt's off whipping his horde into a frenzy, and your hard work has left 'em short on guards. I know you won't like the sound of this, but to truly destroy it, you are going to have to use the bloody thing and get your arses to Norsca.

I'm here to help you escape, and with the Skittergate shaking up this place, the time is now.","nik_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01":"Turns out our BÃ¶genhafen problem's down to a Chaos runesword - the Blightreaper. The good news is that Father Kraussman has it under lock and key in a hidden Sanctum Maleficarum, but that'll not last. Bring it back here. I doubt we can destroy the bloody thing, but I'm prepared to give it a good old Hochland try, as me mother used to say.","nik_keep_idle_shop_08":"Now, I know what you're thinking - you've got to look your best when slaughtering pact-sworn.

","nfl_debrief_bell_01":"I appreciate your,.. unrefined yet somehow successful effort. The bell had to go, and you did your part. Is it likely they will try to mend it and bring it up again? In short - Yes. Where there's vermin, there are bells. No way around it. Anyway, I have some new tidbits of information. The new Warlord of Clan Fester, a brute by the name of Skarrik Spinemanglr, is all brawn and no brain, which could work to our advantage. He is apparently a new addition to Clan Fester, perhaps sent from their superiors, Clan Pestilens. It would help explain the presence of Plague Monks among Fester's forces nowadays. There were none among their ranks during the assault on Ubersreik, remember? My sources tell me Pestilens wanted no truck with Fester in fear of contracting the Brood Blight, but apparently this has changed. I'd say the Skittergate and the pact with the Rotbloods helped along the sudden change of heart among the Plaguelords. They would not pass up an opportunity for conquering the Reikland, after all.","nfl_holly_level_combat_02":"Here they come again. Get this over with!","nfl_forest_ambush_loading_screen_01":"I hope you like skipping merrily through the forest, because that's where you're going next.

They're digging the bloody thing up as we speak, forcing Clan Fester slaves to do the tunnelling. Even worse, the damned monolith's currently beyond our means to destroy. However, Olesya, the clever old girl, has at least found a way to bury the foul thing. So listen closely...","nfl_plaza_event_start_04":"Hold them back, my bonnies!

Anyway, we'll have less of the Bile Trolls terrorizing civilians for awhile but don't delude yourselves, the pact-sworn ranks are still full of the disgusting brutes. And yes, while you were feeding trolls, I received answers on certain inquiries I've made. It seems like preparations for the 'Bile Troll production' were underway long before the invasion. Yes, Helmgart's own secret Nurgle cult, ' The Society of Harmonious Growth and Splendour' was in the mines doing bad things under orders from Sorcerer Lord Halescourge. Did I mention he was also the mysterious emissary who signed the pact with Clan Fester in Stromdorf. No? Well now you know.

It'll probably be raining.","nik_hub_welcome_01":"Welcome to our Keep! Not as homely as the Red Moon perhaps, but it's safe, secluded and sturdier than it looks. Most importantly, it's ideal as a secret base from which to wage a war of resistance. Or rather, Olesya has made it ideal. The portal she opened up to bring you here is powerful Ulgu magic. The Bridge of Shadows. It's what we'll use to get you people to where you need to be, A lot quicker than her old cart, I tell ya.

And, repay the dead in kind, if you follow....","nik_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01":"Listen, Olesya's got a good shot at gaining some proper information about the Skittergate.

In the meantime, it is our duty to strike against the enemy wherever we can, and by any means necessary, impede the work and repairs on the Skittergate. Olesya's using the Bridge of Shadows, which allows us a quick exit.

This means we've delayed the completion of that cursed gate at least a little bit. Now. let's talk about the Rotbloods, and more specifically, their Champion. His name is BÃ¶dvarr Ribspreader and his horde is laying waste to the countryside. I think Kruber laid his lovely eyes on him just before your daring escape from the Grey Seer's paws. We must stop this fiend, but I'm ashamed to say I don't even have his main camp located yet. But trust me, I am working on it.","nfl_plaza_event_halfway_04":"Imbeciles! Must you make so much noise?

Things could be a lot worse...","nfl_cemetery_loading_screen_02":"You're going a little outside of Ubersreik this time. It appears there's a puzzle piece hiding in the graveyard. Let's hope it's not attached to something undead, eh? No, I'm sure it's not. Almost certain, in fact. Try not to worry about it. Anyway, you'll be too busy finding the source of the Skaven poison to worry about details, won't you?","nfl_olesya_weaves_explain_03":"Once you've upgraded your weapon at the Athanor, you'll be able to unlock its true power.

Olesya was looking for you, Kruber.","nik_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01":"Every ratman has one eye on moving up a rung or two, and the other on his rivals.

Hurry!","nik_loading_screen_fort_02":"There are pact-sworn everywhere right now, and if it wasn't for Fort BrachsenbrÃ¼cke, they'd be even farther afield.

The treasure must be near.","nfl_debrief_skaven_stronghold_01":"You weren't fast, you weren't pretty, but you did slay the idiot Warlord, and that, my heroic friends, is definitely worth a cheer and a beer. The ratmen are viciously fighting each other. Chieftains being killed by the scores. Clan Fester's numbers are dropping by the minute, and work on the Skittergate has been halted, for now. We've bought some time, and I would not be surprised if there'll be less vermin guarding the Skittergate now. How come? I predict that the remaining chieftains, who are holding up a safe distance from the Skittergate, will surround themselves with as many loyal clanrats as possible, until the worst of the infighting and paranoia dies down.

It knows your sins.","nfl_debrief_ground_zero_01":"Good, good, good, good... that Halescourge is dead. You however, your performance was a bit... unconvincing. But in the end, it's the results that matter, yes? And had that scum-bucket succeeded, it would have made reaching, and destroying, the Skittergate a lot more troublesome. The mist ritual seems to have been the first step in a dedicated effort to transform what is left of Helmgart into one big poison swamp. I am pleased that isn't happening.","nik_keep_endtimes_11":"Something's got the greenskins of the Worlds Edge Mountains good and riled.

I ain't your servant.","nik_loading_screen_bell_01":"Stop me if you've heard this one before, but the ratmen have raised a bloody great bell up on Helmgart's ramparts. Crazy little buggers will worship anything, near as I can tell. Problem is, there's no way to know if this is a purely ceremonial lump of bronze, or a lodestone for our grey seer's magic. We'll have to destroy it, just to be safe. And by 'we', I mean 'you'.","nik_loading_screen_mines_01":"Those bile trolls ain't natural. Rotblood sorcerers are using some kind of altar to churn 'em out, and it's up to you to disrupt the whole operation with a bloody big bang.

I've had word that Heinrich Kemmler's active again.","nfl_debrief_war_camp_01":"Hah! That shut that stinking champion up! As I suspected, the new champion will obey the orders from his superiors in Norsca. They want him to concentrate on raiding and gathering slaves, not chasing some little insignificant troupe like us. So the search for our Keep has been called off, and we can go back to what we are doing. A good day for all of us.","nik_callout_unready_kerillian_02":"Everyone's ready except you, Kerillian.

Lohner's got folk scrambling to man its walls, and should you free any more prisoners, they now have somewhere safe to go. I bet you are dying to know if old Olesya has any more news on the ratmen? I can tell you she has. First, I have learned that sending out ratmen to the elven ruins, in an attempt to mess with my Bridge of Shadows, was not done by Rasknitt or some Rotblood potentate. And since Warlord Skarrik is just far too dense to have come up with it, evidence suggests there is a new power working behind the scenes in Clan Fester. Second, I know exactly where Skarrik Spinemanglr is nesting. An idiot like him in charge seemed at first only to benefit us, but being only a pawn, with a cunning master pulling his strings, taking him out will only be a good thing. Trust me.","nik_keep_idle_25":"It's like I always say: give me five heroes and I'll change the world. But since I can't find five heroes, you lot'll have to do, won't you? What's the word I'm looking for? Hmmm.... Starts with a 'p' and ends with path.","nfl_whisper_conversation_nine_01":"You look haunted, Kerillian.

I've got work for you tomorrow.","nfl_olesya_weaves_explain_02":"Don't forget - if you stay too long, I'll have to bring you back. Otherwise... Well, let's just say you won't like the number of tentacles you end up with.","nik_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01":"Looks like we've made a friend. After freeing his slaves, burning his supplies, and burying his dreams of power, the Rotblood Champion is more than eager to socialize. He's sending out scores of scouting parties, just for us, and his sorcerers plead to their foul god to reveal our location. These efforts have left his camp a tad bit empty, so I suggest we grab the opportunity to pay him a visit, before he and his army shows up at our door.","nfl_plaza_event_start_01":"It will take time to crack these wards. Go! Do what you do best!","nfl_holly_level_difficulty_02":"So what if the illusion's a little bit vicious? Builds character.","nfl_debrief_ussingen_01":"Oh, the arsonists are back! Well played with fire and black powder. Lots of hungry bellies in the northlander camps tonight. I hear the Rotblood Champion, BÃ¶dvarr Ribspreader, is quite upset with us. First we free his slaves, and now we've burned up his food and loot. I feel obliged to find more opportunities to annoy him. And yes, I almost forgot... I can confirm that Ussingen's Baron Justus Francke had dealings with the secret Nurgle cult active in the area, and left the town right before the Rotbloods attacked it. I hope we can some day lay our hands on him to mete out some justice. Justice for Justus. Hm.","nik_keep_endtimes_18":"There's an Asrai host been spotted, heading for Sylvania. Wonder what that's about?","nfl_debrief_nurgle_01":"So the Monolith's buried? I suppose that was well enough done, but considering the collective amount of heroism in this group, I expected a bit more. Can't say what exactly, but truly great heroes never settle for delivering exactly what you want.. They go one step further, and give you something more precious - something you didn't even realise you truly wanted. Next time, try to surprise an old woman, eh? Now, speaking of surprises, we have one planned for the Rotblood Champion, but I'm afraid it's quite urgent, so go talk to Lohner as soon as you are ready.","nik_keep_idle_04":"How is it I never see the five of you together any more?","nik_callout_unready_kruber_04":"You're still here? Kruber's not ready? He'll be ready, or he'll be thirsty. Real thirsty. ","nik_keep_endtimes_04":"That war we've been preparing for? Looks like it's on its way. Gonna make Helmgart and Ubersreik look like nothing, is what I hear.","nik_keep_endtimes_08":"Is it me, or are the skaven a bit more ... vigorous than normal? I wonder if it's got anything to do with the comet?","nik_hub_idle_05":"That's right. Take your time. That's what our enemies are doing.","nfl_cemetery_skull_interaction_02":"Perhaps you should look closer at that skull?","nik_keep_endtimes_10":"The Mountains of Mourn are ablaze, and the ogres are on the march. Oh good.","nik_crater_loading_screen_02":"We've had a meteor crash down, with all the usual death, destruction and creepy-crawlies coming out of the woodwork. My thumbs are prickling about this one.

There's something hidden in the area around Magnus Tower. All I can say is that I'll know it when I see it. Search every nook and cranny. I'll provide whatever guidance I can, so you'd better listen!

Oh well, power through!","nfl_olesya_light_weave_lore_04":"Don't talk to me about Light.","nfl_olesya_weaves_explain_01":"Collecting Essence reduces the power of the Weave, and draws it closer to the others. Collect enough, and we'll have everything knitted back together in no time.","nik_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01":"I'm hearing rumours of something nasty creeping through BÃ¶genhafen. It starts out as plague, and gets worse from there. Daemon-plants and tentacles, if that sounds familiar. If it doesn't, you ain't been paying attention, 'ave you? My contacts reckon it started in the Pit - the town's poorest district, so do me a solid and get it stopped, would you?","nfl_plaza_event_halfway_03":"Halfway done! Don't give up now!","nfl_debrief_elven_ruins_01":"Not bad, heroic ones. The winds have calmed. My bridge should be able to get you home safely now. I have also learnt a thing or two about Clan Fester. First off, they are quite desperate as their breeders, yes, the Skaven females, are suffering from some apparently incurable affliction. It's known as the Brood Blight and it affects the sole reason for the Breeders existence, which is, of course, their fertility. Here is where Rasknitt appeared, promising Clan Fester a cure for the Brood blight in return for the capture of Ubersreik. So, after nearly escaping death by your hands, he went missing for some time. Upon his return to Clan Fester he somehow managed to blame the defeat in Ubersreik on the former, now dead, Warlord of Clan Fester. Yes, Rasknitt was never the leader of Clan Fester itself, only in charge of the Ubersreik assault. That is what they do - lead when it suits them. So now we have Grey Seer Rasknitt in command of the Skittergate and the pact with the Rotbloods, and a new Warlord of Clan Fester named Skarrik Spinemanglr. I will let you know when I have more on both of them.","nik_whispers_conversation_three_01":"Heard you murmuring in your sleep last night, Bardin.

I can live with that. Nurgle Daemons on the loose however,... ahhh. no. So, I suppose you did well.

'The Society of Harmonious Growth and Splendour'. Bah - these cults worshiping the dark gods always have the most pretentious names, don't they? Anyway, the cult was receiving orders from an old acquaintance, at least by name. Halescourge. Burblespue Halescourge. Ring any bells? Well no matter the state of your memory, he is a Rotblood Sorcerer Lord and currently in command of the northlander forces around Helmgart. So there you have it.","nik_loading_screen_crawl_01":"It's gone a bit quiet hereabouts, so perhaps you lot should take advantage of the lull and have a spot of fun? Why don't you have a drink or two?

The Skittergate will be up again, sooner or later, but first, only at minimal capacity. This is when I will go through it. Well, not me personally of course, but, I have my methods.

Use them to destroy Essence nodes.","nik_hub_greeting_night_28":"The shadow magic protecting us works better at night, apparently.","nik_keep_idle_shop_03":"Just had a fresh consignment in. You might want to check it out.","nik_keep_endtimes_19":"I can't be sure, mind, but my spies reckon Imrik of Caledor's up to something. Not like him to plough a crooked furrow.","nfl_magnus_tower_loading_screen_02":"Here we are again, Magnus Tower. Now, don't get carried away killing every little rat that crosses your path on the way to sounding that ridiculous horn. We're here to solve a mystery, so be sure to listen out for my directions! Pfah! What's the point with any of this? You're only going to forget it all once the illusion's prepared. ","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_twelve_01":"No luck getting that Estalian brandy you wanted. No idea what happened to that other bottle?","nik_keep_idle_16":"And how are you, this fine day?","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_twentytwo_01":"Fancy another game of cards, Kruber?","nik_callout_unready_kerillian_01":"What's the matter elf? Don't tell me you're miraculously in a good mood, and don't want to go out and have the world spoil it for ya?","nik_hub_greeting_rainy_24":"Bit of rain today.","nfl_olesya_gold_weave_mechanic_04":"A ring of blades can be yours, if you kill armoured foes.","nik_whispers_conversation_four_01":"Kerillian, about that last sojourn in Castle Drachenfels ...","nfl_olesya_gold_weave_lore_02":"Gold - both an alchemist's lure, and his weapon.","nfl_olesya_bright_weave_lore_04":"The Bright Wind. The Wind of Fire...","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_six_01":"Bardin? Found you a keg of Bugman's XXX, like you asked.","nfl_plaza_event_finished_03":"That's it! The statue is coming apart!","nfl_olesya_amber_weave_mechanic_03":"Beware the totems.","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_three_01":"How's the new shotte working out? Got it in special, out of Nuln.","npp_keep_idle_banter_one_01":"*shouts* Franz! Will you ask them to keep it down? I can't possibly work under these conditions. ","nfl_holly_level_memory_01":"Now this seems familiar.","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_fifteen_01":"You look disgustingly cheerful, Sienna.","nik_keep_idle_24":"Nice to see you up and about. Didn't think you'd make it back from that last one.","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_sixteen_01":"So the elf deigns us with her presence today?","nfl_olesya_amethyst_weave_mechanic_02":"The slain will seek their revenge.","nfl_olesya_grey_weave_lore_04":"Grey has always been my favourite colour.","nik_keep_idle_painter_02":"I've heard some of you've been looking for Catrinne. Waste of time. She'll show herself when she's good and ready, I'm sure.","nfl_loading_screen_plaza_02":"So, now we know. The dwarfs hid something in the Jungfreud Platz, and we've got the runes to get it free. Unfortunately, some no-good northlander whippersnapper has been meddling with my magic. They've seen what we're up to, and are trying to get there first. Which means you need to grab whatever the dwarfs hid in the statue before they do, and bring it back to the keep.","nfl_olesya_to_the_portal_02":"Stop dragging your heels! Get to the portal!","nfl_olesya_all_weave_objective_kill_04":"Slaughter everyone. Claim their Essence.","nfl_olesya_gold_weave_mechanic_03":"Killing armoured enemies steals their metal.","nfl_olesya_light_weave_lore_02":"Light is purity. Warmth. Hope.","nfl_olesya_tutorial_dlc_skittergate_complete_01":"Lohner and I were just discussing something curious. Something has obliterated the town of Untermais. No loss, but the area's crawling with unspeakables. Perhaps you should take a look?","nik_intro_forge_reminder_01":"The Forge is ready, feel free to use it.","nik_hub_greeting_rainy_26":"Rain won't stop them. We're not fighting Altdorf nobles.","nik_inventory_reminder_01":"Remember, go and have a look-see in your stash when you want to change equipment.","nfl_olesya_light_weave_mechanic_04":"Let it fill you - but not too far. Seek shelter from its embrace.","nfl_olesya_jade_weave_lore_01":"As life thrives from death, so will the Jade Wind from your blood.","nik_keep_idle_02":"Heard back from the Duke of Montfort. Cowardly bugger won't lend us a hand. He'll think different when the ratmen are swarming through Axe Bite Pass.","npp_comet_conversation_ten_01":"Oh Victor! You promised you'd pose for me in front of the comet!","nik_keep_endtimes_06":"Getting so many reports from my agents I can't keep up. Signs. Portents. Everyone's mobilising for war...","nik_whispers_conversation_two_01":"I don't suppose you're going to tell me what happened at Castle Drachenfels, Sienna? You've all been a bit... off ever since. What happened.","nik_keep_idle_shop_07":"Your raiment's looking a bit frayed. Cross my palm with silver, and I'll do something about that.","nik_cog_conversation_twentyeight_01":"I have to say, it's good to see you embracing your true vocation, Bardin.","nfl_olesya_amber_weave_lore_04":"Savagery will serve you amidst Amber.","nfl_forest_ambush_rune_interaction_01":"I have it transcribed. Now, back to business!","nik_hub_greeting_14":"Just another glorious day in the Reikland.","nfl_olesya_all_weave_objective_essence_nodes_03":"The Essence nodes must be destroyed. Use Spark Barrels.","nik_callout_unready_kruber_03":"So, it's Kruber you're waiting for. Double time, Markus. Get your stuff together. ","nfl_olesya_celestial_weave_lore_02":"The future is written in the light of the Celestial.","nfl_olesya_celestial_weave_lore_03":"Destiny stands revealed within, if you can read it.","nik_loading_screen_nurgle_01_short":"It caught our attention that the Rotbloods are digging for something. Turns out they're after the lost Monolith of GhÃ»lmagak. Cursed thing is said to contain the putrid soul of a long-dead Chaos Lord, and I dread to think on the immense power lurking within. Unfortunately, we'd need a score of wizards to even make a dent in the bloody thing, but Olesya has found a way to deal with it, for now at least.","nik_keep_idle_banter_four_02":"She's a funny girl.","nik_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02":"Thanks to our efforts, the locale's seething with northlanders who want to find our merry little hidey-hole and murder us all in our beds. Yes, it's alarming, but it's also an opportunity. The search has left the camp at Ussingfeld Marsh lightly defended - enough for us to turn the tables on our Rotblood friends. I doubt you'll find their champion in his bed, but I'm sure you'll manage the 'murder' part.","nik_keep_endtimes_02":"My agents reckon the dwarfs are mobilising in a throng for the ages. That doesn't bode well.","nik_loading_screen_catacombs_02":"Helmgart's lost folks, but we still have our little ways of keeping eyes and ears down there, and something's going on at the Shallyan Hospice. Whole thing reeks of chaos magic... go and deal with it, would you? Things are bad enough already.","nik_hub_lohner_conversation_five_01":"You're quiet, Saltzpyre. Nothing to say?","nik_bastion_briefing_01":"We're still no nearer to knowing what the Pactsworn are up to, but at least you've found a way inside. See if you can find any survivors from the villages, but first and foremost find out what those grubby buggers are up to. I don't like the feel of this one. No one goes to Drachenfels for innocent reasons. Well, except you lot.","nfl_olesya_final_challenge_prefix_06":"I hope you've some fight left in you.","nfl_cemetery_loading_screen_01":"Back to the illusory world of Ubersreik you go! It seems that there's a piece of the puzzle hiding out in the Garden of Morr. Well, I say hiding out... I doubt it got there without a little help. Have a little bit of a look around. Turn over a few stones. Maybe a few graves. Oh, and find the source of the poison too, for old times' sake.","nfl_olesya_weaves_explain_08":"Remember! Every mote of Essence you reclaim helps get the world back to whatever used to pass for normality. If it ever did.","nik_hub_idle_06":"Think I prefer the Red Moon, rest her, but this ain't such a bad place.","nfl_loading_screen_plaza_01":"I've a small confession. The pact-sworn are onto us. One of their rotting shamans has been meddling with my illusion, and has seen all that I've seen. So while you're going back to Ubersreik, so are our filthy little friends. So go! Quickly! Get whatever it is the dwarfs hid in the Jungfreud Platz before they do!","nik_comet_conversation_four_01":"Nothing to say about the twin-tailed comet, Kerillian?","nfl_olesya_jade_weave_mechanic_03":"Bloodthorns grow swiftly from the dead. Have a care.","nik_crater_loading_screen_01":"Bit of a troubling one for you. Seems we've had a bloody great meteor make a mess. Now, I don't have to tell you that things falling from the sky ain't exactly good news, do I? And that's without some of the other reports I'm getting. Sort it out, would you?","nfl_plaza_event_finished_02":"There! In the statue!","nik_fleur_conversation_nineteen_01":"You know Catrinne's been after you?","nik_callout_unready_kerillian_03":"Who's not ready yet? Kerillian? I bloody hope you're not making some stupid point again. ","nik_callout_unready_bardin_02":"What's holding you up? Oh, I see, Bardin again. Wish he was as quick getting ready as he is downing my ale.  ","nfl_holly_level_memory_04":"Oh look. I'd forgotten about that. Never mind. Ignore me.","nfl_olesya_grey_weave_lore_02":"The Grey Wind. The Wind of Shadows.","nfl_olesya_amethyst_weave_mechanic_03":"Here, the dead can walk. And kill.","nfl_olesya_light_weave_lore_01":"Light. The closest to kindness magic comes. ","nfl_plaza_investigate_04":"If I were a dwarfen treasure stash, where would I be?","nik_hub_idle_12":"This place is more defensible than the Red Moon, but let's hope it doesn't come to that, eh?","nik_loading_screen_fort_01":"Right now, Fort BrachsenbrÃ¼cke is about the only thing stopping the enemy rampaging far and wide, but it's under siege, and about to fall. I need you to do whatever you can to keep the bastion in Imperial hands. The main approach is likely chock-full of pact-sworn, but there is secret entrance upriver. Use it, and defend the fort in any way you can.","nfl_oleysia_grey_weave_mechanic_03":"Your foes will be shrouded from sight.","nfl_plaza_waystone_02":"Well done, my bonnies. I take back a fifth of the terrible things I've said about you.","nfl_olesya_final_challenge_prefix_02":"Almost there. One task remains.","nfl_plaza_survive_04":"Defend yourselves! They've come for the treasure!","nfl_olesya_all_weave_objective_essence_capture_02":"This Weave is weakening. Hold position in its fractures, and your amulet will do the work.","nfl_plaza_event_near_completion_01":"Almost complete. Nice to see you're still alive.","nik_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02":"A large chunk of Clan Fester are currently camped down in the ruins of Karak Gnol. Now, skaven are paranoid little buggers, so you're going to sneak in, kill their Warlord and watch the chaos unfold. I'd love a full-scale civil war, but at the very least, I think we'll delay the work on the Skittergate. Oh, don't look at me like that. You know you'll enjoy it once you're there.","nik_keep_idle_10":"Oi, do you reckon you can stop throwing those practice dummies off the mountain? Those things are expensive.","nik_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02":"The Bridge of Shadows has been a boon, but it seems our enemies may have got wise. Olesya says there's interference in the Winds of Magic, centred around an old elf temple nearby. Take a wander, have a gander, and put a stop to whatever it is they're up to. We've a lot of work to do, and we won't stand a chance if you're left marching up and down the countryside.","nik_keep_idle_18":"There's always someone worse off than us, and no mistake. Something to think on, that.","nik_loading_screen_ground_zero_01":"Now, there's a Sorcerer Lord creating quite a hullabaloo down in what's left of Helmgart. Turns out it's Burblespue Halescourge, the same fat bastard who ordered the theft of my book collection in Ubersreik, remember? Olesya says he's conjuring a city-sized plague mist, which'll make the Rotbloods stronger, and kill any decent folk. So, ride the guildsman's lift into the centre, and just stove his bloody head in. No One steals from me.","nfl_olesya_final_challenge_prefix_05":"You're almost finished. Almost.","nfl_olesya_bright_weave_lore_01":"As you can probably imagine, it'll be hot.","nik_keep_endtimes_01":"Something's got High King Thorgrim roused. Means to strike every grudge remaining in his great book. That's going to mean a thumping. Better check I don't owe him coin.","nfl_olesya_weaves_explain_15":"If you see old Ubersbrom in the Weaves, don't bring him home. If he comes back alive, I lose the bet (laugh).","nfl_olesya_all_weave_objective_essence_shards_03":"Shatter the Essence shards. Use that brawn of yours.","nfl_forest_ambush_watchtower_entrance_01":"This feels... new.","nik_keep_endtimes_20":"The End Times, eh? Well, I suppose nothing good lasts forever. Best thing to do is make it count.","nfl_olesya_final_challenge_03":"They all must die! Leave none standing!"}
