	"pwe_bell_intro_a_02": "I tire of keeping your precious empire clean of Skaven trinkets, mayflies.",
	"pwe_bell_intro_b_01": "Well, half of you lot worship a bearded corpse. Personally I think a bell is preferable.",
	"pwe_bell_intro_b_02": "Mayflies, skaven only appear cunning. We shouldn't read too much method into their madness.",
	"pwe_bell_intro_c_01": "Now, either all of you shut your snaggletooth-holes and get going, or I'm leaving you behind. Again.",
	"pwe_bell_intro_c_02": "All your yammer, lumberfoots. It's enough to make me long for someone's death. Could be yours or could be mine.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_eight_01": "I know. I curse the day we set foot in the Citadel of Eternity.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_five_01": "As it should be. A genuine smile from One-Eye? It is surely a sign that the End Times are upon us.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_four_01": "That by you is might? We have gods who can crack the world apart, drown cities with the seas or exhort whole populations to exquisite savagery. I think your little storm god might be a wee bit outnumbered.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_four_02": "Some will make a stand, have no doubt. Alas, the others are likely waiting to see which side to take.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_nine_01": "I think we all know the answer to that one.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_one_01": "Oh, One-Eye. Such poetry. Next you'll be telling me you've learned the value of mercy.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_one_02": "Glad to hear it. I'd hate to think you've gone soft.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_seven_01": "That's because he likes you, Kruber. He's back to looking strangely at Sienna and I.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_six_01": "He always had a purpose, Bardin. That was the problem.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_three_01": "That magic you manifest, Saltzpyre ... It looks like it tingles. Does it tingle?",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_three_02": "Aye, very impressive. But you didn't answer the question.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_two_01": "I confess, One-Eye, I never really believed Sigmar was a god, but you're making me reconsider.",
	"pwe_bless_conversation_two_02": "Don't push it. ",
	"pwe_bright_weave_conversation_three_01": "Loathsome though it is, something about this place calls to me. ",

	"pwe_bright_weave_conversation_two_01": "Is it hot in here, or is it just me?",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_01": "Monster's caught Sienna! It will devour her to regain its strength!",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_02": "Spawn's taken Sienna! I will ruin that thing like it ruined my mood!",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_03": "Sienna's caught by the Spawn! I expect you to do something, lumberfoots!",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_04": "That unspeakable monstrosity cannot be allowed to live... and much less to gnaw on our Wizard.",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_05": "Spawn's on Sienna! Get the things attention, or she'll lose some part dear to her!",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_06": "Chaos Spawn got Sienna! It shan't do it again!",
	"pwe_bright_wizard_eaten_07": "Tentacle beast's all over our wizard! Doubt she can use her magic while being devoured.",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_eleven_01": "Saltzpyre always hears voices. Mad ones. ",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_eleven_02": "Nothing at all. Leave me be.",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_five_01": "So, One-Eye. If Constant Drachenfels is a myth, why does speaking of him bother you so?",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_five_02": "Aye, that makes a good excuse. It might even stop people believing and following his example. For a time. Until he returns.",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_ten_01": "Then be of good cheer. Your tally increases today.",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_three_01": "You've never been?",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_three_02": "Really? Me too. We should compare notes.",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_two_01": "It couldn't have been anyone else. You don't mistake that manner of evil.",
	"pwe_castle_conversation_two_02": "This was different. It was Old. I pray you never see for yourself.",
	"pwe_castle_intro_line_a_01": "The sorcerer cannot hide. I have an arrow ready just for him",
	"pwe_castle_intro_line_a_02": "Just like a lesser evil to hide in the shadow of a much larger one.",
	"pwe_castle_intro_line_b_01": "No hunt performed in this bleak place can ever be simple.",
	"pwe_castle_intro_line_b_02": "Our quarry has gone to ground in an ill-fated lair. We need to be careful.",
	"pwe_castle_intro_line_c_01": "If you say so. I don't intend to fail.",
	"pwe_castle_intro_line_c_02": "You're a cauldron full of cheer today, aren't you?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_01": "Ugh, that smell. I think the sorcerer's inside.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_02": "That's a vile stench. I'd say we've found the sorcerer.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_03": "The sorcerer's nearby. The foul stench confirms it.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_04": "The sorcerer's close. Can you not smell him?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blockage_01": "Blocked? Can we go around? Can we go through?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blockage_02": "Another obstacle. I'm in no mood to be thwarted.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blockage_03": "Can we go around? Over? Through?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blockage_04": "What now, mayflies? Surely we'll not let this obstacle thwart us?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blood_pool_01": "That fountain almost resembles something my cousins would create.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blood_pool_02": "Look at that! Like Naggarothi art, but not quite as pointy.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blood_pool_03": "At least blood adds a splash of colour to the room.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_blood_pool_04": "Well, that's cheery.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_01": "We're not finished, mayflies. Not until Nurgloth's daemonic master is slain.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_02": "This isn't over. Nurgloth's daemon must be... attended to.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_03": "We have to find and banish Nurgloth's daemon. Only then will this be over.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_04": "We're not done here until the daemon's dealt with. Nurgloth was but a servant.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_01": "Gah! Something's missing, and I don't know what!",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_02": "What have we missed, mayflies? It's annoying me!",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_03": "I have the sense that we've seen something and not fully understood...",
	"pwe_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_04": "We've missed something, mayflies. The question is, what?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_door_open_01": "An open door? What can possibly go wrong?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_door_open_02": "Oh, we're clearly taking them by surprise.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_door_open_03": "So, they know we're here? So much for a stealthy approach.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_door_open_04": "Oh, well done, mayflies. They heard you coming.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_01": "I'm sure this is different to last time.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_02": "Wretched castle, shuffling its chambers like a deck of cards.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_03": "None of this looks like it did before. The details are wrong.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_04": "Oh... It's enchanted. The rooms are always in motion.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_drop_down_01": "Must we go down there?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_drop_down_02": "What is it with this castle and ominous descents?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_drop_down_03": "Down there? Well, if I must, I must.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_drop_down_04": "Into the castle's bowels again, I suppose.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_enter_01": "That door's our only way onwards.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_enter_02": "I don't think we've any choice but that door.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_enter_03": "That door blocks the only route through.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_enter_04": "I don't see any other path. It'll have to be that door.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_01": "Right. Time to head back upstairs.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_02": "I don't know about you lot, but I'm going back upstairs.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_03": "So... Are we heading back upstairs, or giving up?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_04": "Off we go, mayflies. Back up to the castle. We'll try again.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_halls_01": "I think we're back in the castle, mayflies.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_halls_02": "This looks like the castle, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_halls_03": "Are we in the castle? ",
	"pwe_castle_vo_halls_04": "Is this the castle? Thank Lileath.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_hello_01": "It's too quiet...",
	"pwe_castle_vo_hello_02": "Don't be deceived by the quiet, mayflies.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_hello_03": "Silence means nothing. Death is often without clamour.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_hello_04": "This is off to an... unexpected start.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_landed_01": "No one say a word.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_landed_02": "No. That did not happen. Anyone who speaks of it, gets an arrow. Are we clear?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_landed_03": "What have you led me into now, mayflies?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_landed_04": "I knew that was going to happen. I thought you'd worked it out.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_01": "Another mayfly wants to rule the world. Hah!",
	"pwe_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_02": "Such a high opinion of yourself, mayfly.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_03": "The Weave will consume you, as it does all!",
	"pwe_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_04": "Oh please. Spare us. I'm shaking.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_recognize_01": "This isn't our first time in this room.",
	"pwe_castle_vo_recognize_02": "Do you remember when we were here before. Wasn't it fun?",
	"pwe_castle_vo_recognize_03": "It seems we were only here yesterday, doesn't it, mayflies?",

	"pwe_crater_climb_top_04": "Hurry, mayflies! Hurry! Don't you hear their chant? We're running out of time!",
	"pwe_crater_conversation_five_01": "Aye we do. They seek to corrupt and despoil the weave. As humans don't seem interested in stopping them, someone must.",

	"pwe_crater_conversation_three_02": "Oh, they're much worse than that. They're the rot in the very soul of the world.",

	"pwe_crater_forest_ascent_top_02": "Lohner was right to worry... a meteor, and now the corruptors? We must find a way through.",
	"pwe_crater_forest_ascent_top_03": "The beastmen shall be stopped. We need to get through the mountain!",

	"pwe_crater_intro_banter_b_01": "Take notice, for I shall not say it again, but Lohner isn't often worried without reason.",
	"pwe_crater_intro_banter_b_02": "Lohner doesn't worry over nothing.",
	"pwe_crater_intro_banter_c_01": "I don't like this, mayflies. The Weave is weeping.",

	"pwe_crater_plan_banter_a_01": "No! I will not let this be. We'll use the corruptors' sorcery against them. If the ritual is disrupted...",
	"pwe_crater_plan_banter_a_02": "Brave heart, Kerillian. There's always a way... Aye! If we disrupt that ritual...",
	"pwe_crater_plan_banter_b_01": "...the warpstone will feed on itself. It might even implode. That's actually a good idea, though the cost to us...",
	"pwe_crater_plan_banter_b_02": "...the sorcery will run out of control, and the warpstone will consume itself. It's a bold plan, mayflies. And it carries a risk...",
	"pwe_crater_plan_banter_c_01": "...So? Death in the service of the Weave is the highest calling! Let us be off!",
	"pwe_crater_plan_banter_c_02": "...It matters not. We owe all to the Weave. Our lives, and our deaths. Come!",
	"pwe_crater_rim_vista_01": "Lileath! What can we do about so much warpstone? The first of us to lay hand on it will unravel.",
	"pwe_crater_rim_vista_02": "Ach! The meteor's too vast. We can kill all the corruptors we wish, and still it will change nothing.",
	"pwe_crater_rim_vista_03": "There's more warpstone than we can hope to destroy, but we can still drown it in corruptor blood!",
	"pwe_crater_rim_vista_04": "Lileath forgive me, but we can do nothing to that much warpstone, and there's no time to seek help...",
	"pwe_crater_tracking_camp_01": "This isn't a skaven camp... or skaven work.",
	"pwe_crater_tracking_camp_02": "Tread lightly, lumberfoots. This is more than it seems...",
	"pwe_crater_tracking_camp_03": "Don't be fooled by the skaven... This is something else.",
	"pwe_crater_tracking_camp_04": "This isn't the ratmen. The signs tell a different story.",
	"pwe_crater_vista_reveal_01": "The sky weeps. The Weave trembles. What has become of this place?",
	"pwe_crater_vista_reveal_02": "I hear the Weave hissing its pain. This is unnatural, mayflies. It must not stand.",
	"pwe_crater_vista_reveal_03": "The sky should not be thus. The Weave shudders. It is our duty to bring this to an end.",
	"pwe_crater_vista_reveal_04": "Lileath! What happened here? The veil of dreams is torn asunder.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_intro_01": "The trees, the buildings... Was this a warpstone meteor? It must be taken, or destroyed.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_intro_02": "This forest deserved better, mayflies. We must find the warpstone meteor at the crater's heart and put it beyond use.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_intro_03": "Warpstone fell from the sky and did all... this. We must find it, before it is put to evil purpose.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_intro_04": "The Weave recoils. There is warpstone at the crater's heart. We must find it, and destroy it.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_tree_push_01": "That tree is already dead. Let it serve our crossing.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_tree_push_02": "Fell the dead timber. It may serve us yet.",
	"pwe_crater_wasteland_tree_push_03": "That dead tree can find purpose yet.",

	"pwe_crawl_conversation_four_01": "This? This is nothing. I'm perfectly... thing... You know. Sober.",
	"pwe_crawl_conversation_nine_01": "I miss my horse. He was so beautiful... And wise...",
	"pwe_crawl_conversation_nine_02": "Aye, and a good thing too. If the skaven hadn't eaten him, Bardin would have.",
	"pwe_crawl_conversation_seven_01": "I hate to say this Saltzpyre, but we've much in common. No one likes us, for starters.",
	"pwe_crawl_conversation_seven_02": "By who? Name one?",
	"pwe_crawl_conversation_seven_03": "Name one who isn't lying.",
	"pwe_crawl_conversation_ten_01": "And you're a tolerable dwarf, despite the smell, the singing and that excruciating accent. Did I mention the smell?",

	"pwe_crawl_get_out_soon_01": "Pretty flames. Can't you see them smiling, mayflies?",

	"pwe_crawl_head_for_second_pub_03": "Oh no. I'm sobering up. You don't want that, lumberfoots. Let's find another inn.",

	"pwe_crawl_loud_crash_03": "Now they'll be coming, and they'll want our Bugman's!",

	"pwe_crawl_pub_brazers_01": "How nice: the fires are burning in welcome.",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_brazers_02": "Nearly there, mayflies. Then we'll see who can really hold their drink.",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_brazers_03": "Can't you smell the dwarfen ale? Like old boots left out in the rain. I can't wait!",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_brazers_04": "This had better be worth it, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_destroyed_01": "Well, that's not something you see every day. Unless you're us.",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_destroyed_02": "No! Where's my drink?",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_destroyed_03": "Who did that? Show yourselves! You can't come between an elf and her drink like that!",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_destroyed_04": "And now we have to fight. Ah, it's like Araloth's Birth-Feast all over again...",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_district_sign_01": "Tavern district? We're in the right place, mayflies!",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_district_sign_02": "A whole section of the town given over to drinking? Degenerates! I like them more already!",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_district_sign_03": "So this is the tavern district? My prayers, answered!",

	"pwe_crawl_pub_door_02": "*beckoning whistle* Little door... Where are you?",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_door_03": "Oh, it's no use. Let's just have a little sleep and try again in the morning.",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_door_04": "I want to get inside. Please. I just want a drink, just one. Is that so much to ask?",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_horde_end_01": "That's not fair! Now I'm thirstier than ever!",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_horde_end_02": "So many bodies. So much death. More please!",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_horde_end_03": "They look so much smaller when they're dead, don't they? Like little dolls. Can we stuff one and keep it as a souvenir?",
	"pwe_crawl_pub_horde_end_04": "I don't know about you, mayflies, but I really need that drink now.",
	"pwe_crawl_shortcut_01": "Yes. Yes. Yes! We'll go through the park.",
	"pwe_crawl_shortcut_02": "We'll go around - through the park. You may applaud my genius later.",
	"pwe_crawl_shortcut_03": "We could always go through the park, mayflies. Last one through buys my drinks!",
	"pwe_crawl_shortcut_04": "We can go through the park.",
	"pwe_crawl_slaughter_01": "They've spilt all their ale! Serves them right.",
	"pwe_crawl_slaughter_02": "Quick! Check the bottles for dregs. They've no need of them!",
	"pwe_crawl_slaughter_03": "Don't they look pretty? Like wilted flowers all covered in red wine. Oooh. Red wine. Is there any?",
	"pwe_crawl_slaughter_04": "Like so many broken dolls. I had a doll once. I had to keep it tied up. Otherwise it stabbed all the other children.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_01": "Ach! A dwarf tavern? Their ale is nothing but grit and mould. Still, I'll outdrink you all!",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_02": "The Hungry Troll? What kind of name is that?",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_03": "A dwarf tavern. Ale on the floors, on the walls and in every beard. Lead on!",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_04": "Dwarfs are filthy brewers, but it just so happens I like filthy brew.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_01": "Must you go so slow, Mayflies? I'm thirsty.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_02": "A tavern! Make way for Queen Kerillian the First!",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_03": "Are we there yet?",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_04": "Are we going in circles, mayflies? Hah! Mayflies going in circles. Flitter, flitter, flitter.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_second_pub_01": "Oh, that's disappointing.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_second_pub_02": "So unfair. Especially after we've travelled all this way.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_second_pub_03": "So unfair. I'll bet it burned down out of spite!",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_second_pub_04": "The tavern's gone? Oh, that's heart-breaking. I really wanted that drink.",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_third_pub_01": "The Obese Megalalalaladon. Am I pronouncing it right?",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_third_pub_02": "The Obese Megalodon. Let's drink it dry!",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_third_pub_03": "Now that's a sturdy looking tavern. Let's try inside!",
	"pwe_crawl_spot_third_pub_04": "The Obese Megalodon? I hereby proclaim it, and everything within, the property of Queen Kerillian the First!",
	"pwe_crawl_tunnel_passage_01": "I can't say I like what they've done to the place.",
	"pwe_crawl_tunnel_passage_02": "I like the tunnel. Very artisanal.",

	"pwe_gameplay_response_156": "Seems a fine match to me, mayflies.",

	"pwe_gameplay_response_158": "You're keeping One-eye too close then, Wizard.",

	"pwe_gameplay_response_160": "You barely winged it. Poor thing must've been dying already.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_161": "That means I have something in common with Markus Lumberfoot. I must re-evaluate if killing trolls is really that fun.",

	"pwe_gameplay_response_163": "'Plan'? That's a fancy word for panic, isn't it?",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_164": "I know that!",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_165": "Only compared to you, sergeant.",

	"pwe_gameplay_response_172": "And yet you still had wind enough to beg for help...",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_173": "I do not! Cursed things keep coming for me.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_174": "Maybe that's the problem. Easy to predict.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_175": "Too fast for you, leastways.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_176": "Not me. I've a fair idea what's waiting.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_177": "Fine words, but I shouldn't test them on what lies beyond yon portal.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_178": "And yet you seem to seek them out...",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_179": "It got lucky. That's all.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_180": "That's the problem with Spawn. You never know what you're hitting.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_181": "All you mayflies stink, wizard. Especially these Northlanders.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_182": "It's the only language Spawn understand. That, and gibbering.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_183": "I suspect there's many such pleasures yet to come.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_184": "Make sure to wipe it away. Who knows what breeds in the spittle?",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_185": "Just making sure, wizard! You can't be too careful.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_186": "Who can say, with a Spawn? It was a mess to begin with.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_187": "On this, at least, we agree.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_188": "I am. Never sure what to shoot at with a Spawn.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_189": "Nor did the Spawn.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_190": "At this moment? Prickly as a spinehog.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_191": "A swift shot evens all battles, even against a Spawn.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_192": "A target that size? It was hard to miss.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_193": "It once thought that too, One Eye!",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_194": "It's only a Spawn. Plenty worse out in the world, mayflies.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_195": "They do that, from time to time.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_20": "I could put an arrow in your arse, One-Eye? It might help you stay in the moment?",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_22": "Quiet, Dwarf.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_23": "A lapse. Nothing more.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_24": "Filthy thing. I never want to touch one again.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_25": "They loathe your voice, you mean.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_26": "You know nothing.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_27": "Perhaps once or twice more, wizard.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_28": "Want that I should make you like a boar on a spit, hold-seeker?",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_29": "Truly, Kruber, you are a wit to last out the ages.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_35": "Don't you think I would if I could?",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_36": "Silence, dwarf.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_38": "Stop... distracting me.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_39": "I can mar it with your blood, should you prefer, One-Eye.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_40": "It was well done. You have a talent for slaughter, pyromancer.",
	"pwe_gameplay_response_41": "It should only serve to make the kill that much sweeter.",

	"pwe_hub_lohner_conversation_sh_two_02": "You keep talking more about an insignificant event, and now adding the wellspring of insignificance that occurred after the first event. of no significance whatsoever. Your mind is addled from the dwarf 'food' you've been cooking, Lohner.",
	"pwe_hub_lohner_conversation_sixteen_01": "For now. Perhaps you'd like to kiss my feet, while you have the chance?",

	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_01": "Wake the brazier. Let's see what we have.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_02": "Can we wake that brazier?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_03": "Set the torch to the brazier, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_04": "We'll need more light. Wake the brazier.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_01": "Waste no tears for the mayfly. Does he have the key?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_02": "We have the key, so the priest's death matters little.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_03": "Dead and gone. But does he still have the key?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_04": "So much for the protection of the mighty Sigmar.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_01": "More proof that Sigmar is but a speck amongst the divine.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_02": "How feckless must Sigmar be, to allow this in his temple?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_03": "Lileath! What a mess.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_04": "Lileath! Is there no end to this corruption?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_01": "I feel that sword gnawing at my spirit. Better we bring it to Lohner, and fast.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_02": "We're not out of this yet!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_03": "Seek the waystone, mayflies, before we're overrun.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_04": "We should be gone. Every moment we linger tempts fate.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_01": "Of course the priest isn't where he promised.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_02": "Where is this wretched priest? I suppose we'll have to find him.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_03": "The gate's locked, and the priest is missing. Perfect.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_04": "Well, I see our priest is as reliable as the rest of his ilk.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_01": "There! We have it!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_02": "A revolting blade. Fit only for scunners.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_03": "Do we have the sword? About time.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_04": "So much desolation from so insignificant a sword. A lesson for us all.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_01": "A three-legged skeleton? Sounds like the start of a bad joke...",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_02": "Who'd go to the trouble of putting a three-legged skeleton down here?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_03": "A three-legged goblin? Admittedly, he's lost a little weight.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_04": "Starved bones don't exactly inspire confidence...",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_01": "At least we'll not be bored!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_02": "Seems we're getting playmates!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_03": "The scunners return. Let's make them regret it!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_04": "Brave heart, lumberfoots. We'll not die here!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_01": "The wealthy streets are thick with infestation.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_02": "Proof, as if any were needed, that the rot began in wealthy streets.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_03": "See there? The wealthy quarter seethes with the unnatural.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_04": "Coin is no defence against the Dark Gods. And greed too often calls them forth.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_01": "See? This is what happens when you let dwarfs play with magic.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_02": "I hope removing the sword heals Bögenhafen's ills. But I am not sure.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_b_01": "The Blightreaper once came to Athel Loren. That was a black day... Some of the glades never recovered.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_b_02": "We know of the Blightreaper in Athel Loren. Scarloc once slew its bearer. If only he'd destroyed the sword as well.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_c_01": "Can we trust this priest? Friend of Saltzpyre's or not, there's much that could go wrong.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_c_02": "Well, Bögenhafen's fate's in the hands of a priest now, mayflies. What could possibly go awry?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_01": "Do you want to be left behind? Keep moving!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_02": "Hurry, lumberfoots. We can't stay here.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_03": "They want the sword!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_04": "We can't rest yet. We need to keep moving.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_01": "Mayflies. Who else would find a series of loud bangs 'exciting'?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_02": "Here's us, shedding blood in the town's defence. There's them, drinking heavily and deaf to it all.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_03": "Oh, there's nothing I like more than risking my life while others celebrate...",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_04": "Drunk, blind and insensate. Just like all mayflies. We should let them rot.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_01": "Look for a lever. A switch. Anything.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_02": "Look for a switch.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_03": "Where is the switch?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_04": "Let's find that switch, while we are still able!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_01": "One to go.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_02": "Almost!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_03": "One more, lumberfoots. Quickly now!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_04": "Can we finish this, please?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_01": "A glimpse of green does not guarantee spring.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_02": "There's little time. Pick up the pace.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_03": "One step closer, I suppose.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_04": "We've more to do. Don't stop.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_01": "Drizzle to match my mood.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_02": "Thank Isha! The rain washes away the stench.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_03": "Stop scowling. It's only a little rain.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_04": "At least the rain is clean. Unlike much of this town.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_01": "That cheer is born of ignorance.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_02": "There are no eyes so blind as those who refuse to see.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_03": "Our actions may yet save their bodies, but their souls are thick with hedonism's rot.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_04": "Too much joy, and with too little cause. Mayflies ever celebrate too soon.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_01": "There is a hidden room. It must be the sanctum we seek.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_02": "The sanctum must be here, and so must its entrance.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_03": "There will be a concealed entrance to the sanctum. Seek its release.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_04": "Seek a mechanism, lumberfoots. The sanctum must be revealed.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_01": "No good will come of reading from these shelves, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_02": "A collection of primitive daubings, and dark primal truths.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_03": "So many secrets in one place. So many timeless perils.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_04": "Can you not hear them? The books want to be freed. We must leave them be.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_01": "Oh, I see we came the pretty way, as usual.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_02": "We don't exactly see these places at their best, do we?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_03": "Crawling through muck, with death waiting all around...",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_04": "You do show me the prettiest places, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_01": "We ruined a perfectly good slum quarter, do you know that?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_02": "The fires still blaze. We may have overstepped.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_03": "That's some blaze. A warm night on the northern bank, for those who live.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_04": "That's our handiwork blazing still. So much water nearby, and no wit to use it.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_one_01": "The next time Lohner sends us into a sewer, I've a mind to refuse.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_one_02": "And how are your feet, Kruber?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_six_01": "You wouldn't want this particular broth, Goreksson. It's got mayflies in it.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_ten_01": "Is that a note of concern I hear, Saltzpyre?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_ten_02": "We'll do what we can. But there are no guarantees.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_three_01": "They don't. Not true dwarfs. Most of them live out east, in a land of spires and flame.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_story_twelve_01": "And a heart of stone... But just this once, I agree with him.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_01": "Faster! There's too much at stake to linger.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_02": "As usual, you set a turgid pace.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_03": "At this rate, there'll be nothing of the town left to save.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_04": "Come along, lumberfoots. Must you dawdle?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_01": "We must return to the temple.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_02": "The temple, and with haste!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_03": "Back to the temple. We've no time to lose.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_04": "To the temple. We've wasted enough time already.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_01": "Bring the torch. We'll need it.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_02": "We'll need that torch.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_03": "Light is always welcome. If only the torch didn't stink so.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_04": "This will be easier with the torch than without it.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_01": "Well, that solves our problem, doesn't it? The blockage is gone.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_02": "The way is open, thanks to the foe.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_03": "Our foes have set us free.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_04": "The enemy has cleared the path. Hah!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_01": "So, the trap is sprung?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_02": "They come gladly to their deaths, do they not?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_03": "Come scunners! Death awaits you!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_04": "Stay together, lumberfoots. They mustn't divide us!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_01": "Waste no more time! Burn it to ash!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_02": "The tainted provisions must burn.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_03": "What are we waiting for? Burn it all!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_04": "Set it all aflame! Fire cleanses all.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_01": "We need a door, and that cannon stands idle.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_02": "Well, if the powder's dry, that cannon can make our exit.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_03": "We're out of options. The cannon, and quickly.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_04": "We'll have to use the cannon. Morai-Heg curse me for saying so.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_01": "I'm filthy and I'm sore, and yet I know we're coming back to this sullen town.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_02": "No answers, and more questions. Lohner is sure to send us back.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_03": "We have purged a portion of the evil, no more. This is not over.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_04": "We're not finished here, mayflies. As much as I wish it otherwise...",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_01": "We'll have to run, or as close as you can manage.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_02": "Keep moving! There's no end to them!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_03": "Keep running, lumberfoots! We've come too far to fall now!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_04": "Faster! Nethu take you all for your slowness.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_01": "At last. Let's get this over with.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_02": "I'd say this is the place, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_03": "Would you say this warrants a closer look?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_04": "At last. Turn over enough leaves, and the roots reveal themselves.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_01": "We need better ground. A room to fortify.",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_02": "We cannot face them out here. Can we barricade that room?",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_03": "We need to fight on stronger ground. Fortify that room!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_04": "The battle turns, and not in our favour. We'll barricade that room!",
	"pwe_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_01": "Bar the windows! The fewer surprises, the better!",

	"pwe_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_01": "Isha! This is worse than I thought. Dark powers gather in our path.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_02": "This is not mortal filth. It is the spoor of true madness, given viscous form.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_03": "The Dark Realms intrude upon our world. This is not good, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_04": "Are you too glaikit to recognise the truth of this? Our foes do the bidding of Nurgle.",

	"pwe_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_01": "No! They wouldn't dare... They seek to summon a daemon!",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_02": "It's a daemon summoning, woven from death and decay!",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_03": "So this is why they stole the dead? To feed their daemon-ritual?",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_04": "The sorcerers must be silenced! They work to summon a greater daemon.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_story_four_01": "So many books. It's almost impressive, is it not, Kruber?",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_story_four_02": "What tone? I merely complimented this fine library.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_story_four_03": "(laugh) You really must learn to cultivate some self-esteem, Kruber.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_story_seven_01": "I only repeat what I've seen in dreams. A gilded cage, and a cauldron. She weeps, and her tears fall upon this world like rain.",

	"pwe_level_catacombs_story_two_01": "Those without swords seldom do when war reaches their door.",

	"pwe_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_01": "I'm guessing that was the wrong switch.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_02": "I think we'll have to choose again.",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_03": "Maybe the right switch next time?",
	"pwe_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_04": "So, how do we feel like that went, mayflies? Or is the door open, and I just can't see it?",
	"pwe_level_chaos_war_camp_arena_01": "A circle of death, marked in blood.",
	"pwe_level_chaos_war_camp_arena_02": "Wait... is this an arena?",

	"pwe_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_01": "For every obstacle bested, another arises. In this case, another wall.",
	"pwe_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_02": "No celebrating, mayflies. There's a second wall, yet.",
	"pwe_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_03": "I see another wall. Knowing our luck, there'll be a third beyond, and a dragon beyond that.",

	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_03": "Well, if they paid reverence to this mighty one, perhaps the Ulthuani of this place were not so foolish after all.",

	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_clearing_02": "The style is familiar enough to provoke a pang, but only a brief one.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_clearing_03": "The stones themselves are infused with memories. They speak of loss, and of dying days.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_clearing_04": "Even in decay, this place reeks of arrogance. How easily forgotten are once-necessary duties.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_cliff_edge_01": "If anyone's after some broken bones, now's the time.",

	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_02": "The ruins pulse with magic. And magic is at the heart of our woes.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_03": "My cousins build readily enough, but tend their works with less enthusiasm.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_04": "Everything falls in time. Even the work of elves.",

	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_first_aligned_pleasant_feeling_04": "That feels good. Do you sense the tumult fading?",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_01": "This land is tainted, but it fights to be free of the corruption.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_02": "Can you not hear the voices of the trees? They cry for our help.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_03": "There is nothing wrong with this glade that slaughter could not cure.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_04": "There is an age of wisdom in this place. It is hoarded amidst the roots, and speaks only to those worthy of its secrets.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_01": "These trees have been corrupted by wild magic. It is mercy to shatter their boughs.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_02": "No clear way through. Very well, we'll forge our own path.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_03": "Kind words and good intentions will not part these boughs. Steel will have to serve.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_04": "If we are to pass, this maze must be parted.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_interior_01": "Keep a true course, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_interior_02": "A clear head and a keen eye will find us a way through.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_interior_03": "Surely this maze does not confuse you, lumberfoots?",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_maze_interior_04": "Keep at it! We can find a way through.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_01": "(laugh) It's working! It's working!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_02": "Hush your noise, misused core. This will soon be over.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_03": "That's it, mayflies!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_04": "That sound will draw attention!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_proper_01": "Back, creatures! I shall not abide your presence here a moment longer!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_proper_02": "The temple is... aware? As if it knows the depths of its failure.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_proper_03": "We cannot cleanse this place, the enemy is too strong. But we can perhaps undo their works.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_proper_04": "Isha! I feel a resonance here. So many memories, fighting their way to the surface.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_01": "Eyes sharp, mayflies! This ravine's a bottleneck.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_02": "Hurry, lumberfoots! Don't let a little water slow you down!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_03": "Perfect spot for an ambush, what say we turn the tables?",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_04": "There's a foul stench in the air. Keep a sharp eye.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_01": "The temple remembers its purpose!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_02": "The temple is coming to life! Keep going!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_03": "That's it, mayflies! Just one more!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_04": "One more, mayflies. The magic is receding!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_01": "See the core? It's lost alignment.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_02": "The core has been disrupted. No wonder the leylines are so fractious.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_03": "If we can realign the core, there's a chance to put things right.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_04": "We must reach the core, and put it right, if we can.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_01": "The crystals control the mechanism.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_02": "The crystals, mayflies. Must I do everything?",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_03": "Look for the control crystals. They should respond to touch.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_04": "Find the crystals mayflies. The configuration suggests three in total.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_01": "This will be the world's fate before long, mayflies. Torn apart by uncontrolled magic.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_02": "We've found the source of our woes, lumberfoots. Arrogance and sabotage spawned it.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_03": "We must enter that maelstrom. Gird yourselves.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_04": "The temple may be beyond saving. Nevertheless, we must try.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_01": "(spit) Ratmen have no place here.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_02": "The foul banners of Clan Fester. They have become our shadow.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_03": "The Skaven dare come so close to the temple? Teach them their folly!",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_04": "The rats have grown comfortable here.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_eleven_01": "Those who remain would as gladly skewer a dwarf as a Skaven.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_eleven_02": "And how would your vaunted Grimnir look upon my kind?",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_eleven_03": "Deference? (laugh) To a bearded lunatic?",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_eleven_04": "Aye, indeed.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_four_01": "There's nothing more beautiful than nature unbound, sergeant. You should learn to appreciate it.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_four_02": "(laugh) You're a refreshing soul, Kruber.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_one_01": "My people? These were not my people. They exiled us, cast us out. So certain of their path, with so little cause.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_six_01": "And, unless you show a little more respect it will be a long time again.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_three_01": "You're one to talk, Dwarf. One little earthquake, and your kind took to hiding amongst the rocks, instead of ruling from atop them.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_three_02": "Then take my advice: do not bide too long, lest the world also reclaim your lands as it has this place.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_two_01": "Only that it was raised by fools, who sought control over everything else.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_story_two_02": "(bitter laugh) They are not my people, wizard. Not any more. Ulthuan is tomb, only no one there knows that they are already dead.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_01": "We are finished with this place. Let it be forgotten once more.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_02": "Farewell, haunt of my distant kin.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_03": "Olesya calls the Bridge of Shadows. That's our cue to leave.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_04": "The temple is whole again, in all ways that matter. Let us depart.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_untouched_01": "At last, a bit of real wilderness. It almost reminds me of home.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_untouched_02": "Would that the whole world regained this splendour.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_untouched_03": "Far from axes and greed, the natural world blossoms and breathes a sigh of relief.",
	"pwe_level_elven_ruins_untouched_04": "This place is a wonder. There should be more of its kind.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_cart_01": "Move that cart, mayflies!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_cart_02": "Lumberfoots? That cart's in the way!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_cart_03": "The cart is blocking the gate. Maybe we should move it?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_cart_04": "That cart needs moving. (disgruntled noise) Must I do it myself?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_deserted_01": "We're too late this time, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_deserted_02": "On this occasion, we have no salvation to bring.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_deserted_03": "There's no one to save, lumberfoots. Make your peace with that.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_deserted_04": "The farm has fallen. We cannot save its folk.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_end_level_01": "No more cages, and no more folk to save. We should move on.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_end_level_02": "Normally I loathe playing the mayfly hero, but today...?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_end_level_03": "The captives are free. We can take our leave.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_end_level_04": "No more cages to break, and no more captives to save. Time we were gone.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_fence_01": "Can you not climb that fence, lumberfoots?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_fence_02": "Oh, does that lofty little fence intimidate you, mayflies? Climb over before you die of old age.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_fence_03": "Blessed Gods, climb over the fence.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_fence_04": "We need to climb the fence, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_01": "Well, that's the first farm. Let's get it over with.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_02": "There's your farm, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_03": "There's a farm coming up. Or what's left of one.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_04": "That place was overrun. It'll be blood and ruin in there.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_kill_the_brute_01": "Fall, brute!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_kill_the_brute_02": "Another monster falls. It has paid for its brutality.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_kill_the_brute_03": "(laugh) All of a sudden, my spirits are lifted!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_kill_the_brute_04": "Does its blood satisfy you, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_last_farm_01": "Morgensloft isn't far. Steel yourselves for the worst, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_last_farm_02": "Personally I wouldn't object to finding a few mayflies yet alive at Morgensloft.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_last_farm_03": "Morgensloft draws close, and our rescue mission begins.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_last_farm_04": "Do any captives yet live at Morgensloft? We'll soon find out.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_locked_gate_01": "No way through that gate, lumberfoots. Not without a key.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_locked_gate_02": "Is there another way in? No... find the key.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_locked_gate_03": "Perhaps there's a key nearby.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_locked_gate_04": "Unless you've a better idea mayflies, I suggest we look for a key.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_monster_in_barn_01": "...is there something in the barn? Open the door!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_monster_in_barn_02": "...what's that sound? Something in the barn?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_monster_in_barn_03": "...there's something brutal in the barn. Open it up and be ready!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_monster_in_barn_04": "The barn. There's something within. Something... hungry.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_move_on_01": "We cannot help the dead. Our efforts are better spent on the living.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_move_on_02": "We can't waste time. Morgensloft needs us.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_move_on_03": "We can do little more here, except slake our blades.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_move_on_04": "We should leave, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_next_farm_01": "There's no time to avenge the dead - not if we would save the living.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_next_farm_02": "No cages. At least, not here.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_next_farm_03": "We ought to press on, while we can.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_next_farm_04": "There is nothing left for us at this farm.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_no_prisoners_01": "No one to free. Just bodies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_no_prisoners_02": "There's no captives here, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_no_prisoners_03": "No prisoners here, not that we expected any.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_no_prisoners_04": "Gods! There's been a slaughter here.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_orchard_01": "These trees are tamed. They're all but dead.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_orchard_02": "A cruel way to treat them. The poor trees are screaming. Can you not hear it?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_orchard_03": "It makes me shudder to see what you mayflies do to the trees.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_orchard_04": "See what your farmers have done to these trees, mayflies? Bound, mutilated and twisted.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_portal_01": "Make for the portal, but I've a feeling we'll be back this way.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_portal_02": "Into the portal, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_portal_03": "Make for the Bridge of Shadows. We'll need Lohner's aid if we're to help the town.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_portal_04": "The portal opens. Perhaps Olesya can deliver us into the benighted town. Wouldn't that be fun, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_prisoners_01": "No more cages. Not while I draw breath.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_prisoners_02": "Free your fellows, mayflies. This much, at least, we can do.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_prisoners_03": "You found your kin, mayflies. Kept alive for a reason.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_prisoners_04": "We could free the captives quietly, without blood spilled, but where would be the fun in that?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_smoke_plume_01": "That smoke! The scunners have turned their attention to a town.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_smoke_plume_02": "The town is beset. That's a great many souls beneath the slaver's lash.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_smoke_plume_03": "The scunners are razing Ussingen!",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_smoke_plume_04": "Smoke on the horizon brings more than a breath of bitterness.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_story_nine_01": "I was warned that certainty would lead me astray. Now see what my actions have wrought.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_story_nine_02": "Indeed, but firm action slithers a brood all of its own. Only a fool could claim to know their ambitions.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_story_nine_03": "Then ignore me. It's better for us both.",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_story_one_01": "A fine upbringing. Close to the land is close to the Weave. Who knows, Kruber. Perhaps you're marked by it?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_story_six_01": "Hah! The scourge of heretics lectures me on compassion?",
	"pwe_level_farmlands_story_six_02": "You mean to say you'd fight for my kind, if they needed you?",

	"pwe_level_ground_zero_precarious_04": "It's a long way down. Careful you don't fall.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_smell_01": "A vile smell. The Dark Gods are at work here.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_smell_02": "Like fermented flesh, steeped in dung,",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_smell_03": "Can we please not linger. That stench...",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_smell_04": "That's daemon-stench. We must be close.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_eight_01": "Of course not!",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_eight_02": "The Weave transcends the divine. Your 'Sigmar' serves it. As do we all.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_five_01": "Ruin, Master Hold-seeker, and at a swift gallop.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_five_02": "Neither you or I have grounds to speak of 'good sense' dwarf. Our actions have made that quite clear.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_nine_01": "And when the stone crumbles, dwarf? When the metal rots? When there is no timber to fuel the forge?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_nine_02": "But will it be a world worth fighting for?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_seven_01": "It is the heart and soul of the world. Its suffering is ours also.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_seven_02": "Or perhaps you merely missed the significance? Make no mistake, you are bound to its fate.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_six_01": "Well, Sienna, you'll have to set it boiling, will you not?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_six_02": "Well I'm certainly looking forward to it.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_six_02_x": "Have a care. There are fires fiercer than yours.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_six_x": "Don't tell me you're looking forward to the experience.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_ten_01": "Every moment the blighted garden has purchase on our world, is a moment in which the Weave trembles.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_ten_02": "It does, Sienna. What purpose do you think I serve?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_two_01": "Tell me, Kruber - do you even know how these lifting platforms work?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_story_two_02": "Well, I'm sure it's not a long list.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_01": "Lileath! The devastation!",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_02": "Such damage to the Weave! The town is a gnat-bite by comparison.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_03": "So perhaps Helmgart is sorer harmed than I thought.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_04": "Senseless destruction. Slaughter should always serve purpose.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_second_view_01": "What a bleedin' righteous mess. As I said, we owe payback for this, mates.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_second_view_02": "Poor bloody Helmgart. And I thought we had it bad in Ubersreik.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_second_view_03": "Just gets worse the more I see. What have they done?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_the_hole_second_view_04": "More dead down there than I can count, I promise you that.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_town_01": "Well, the town could look worse.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_town_02": "All that fuss about this place. Look at it - hardly scratched.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_town_03": "I thought Helmgart was in ruins. Has Lohner been at his own ale?",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_town_04": "Seems reports of Helmgart's devastation were... premature.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_01": "Hah! Hear that? They've sent us a welcome!",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_02": "Not much of an ambush, is it? I can hear them from up here.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_03": "Hark at that. They're ready for us, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_04": "They've come to greet us. I hear them squalling below.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_armoury_01": "The ratmen have taken most things of value.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_armoury_02": "If you see anything of value, take it.",

	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_armoury_04": "Little of value remains.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_01": "At last. Took you long enough, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_02": "Well, we're here. What about this bell Lohner wants ringing?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_03": "This is the place, I assume. I'd hate to think we came this way all for nothing.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_04": "So we're at the temple. What now?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_01": "Axe Bite Pass. I do walk the very prettiest of roads.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_02": "Is that Axe Bite Pass? A tiny crack in a wall of grey.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_03": "Axe Bite Pass. Beyond it, Bretonnia. Beyond that, Athel Loren. It has been too long.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_04": "I hope Axe Bite Pass does not feature in our future. Greenskins are so... unseemly.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_courtyard_event_01": "(laugh) More fodder for the daughter of Athel Loren!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_courtyard_event_02": "They're coming for us! The fools!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_courtyard_event_03": "Found your courage, have you? You'd have done better to flee!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_courtyard_event_04": "They're coming, lumberfoots. Fight on!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_01": "We have a door, and a chance to leave.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_01a": "Am I to be impressed by a blown out door? Such waste of energy.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_02": "The door opens, and the future with it.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_02a": "Well, one less door means a handy way out.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_03": "Was that door part of Lohner's plan?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_03a": "So the temple provides an exit? It's the least it can do to thank us.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04": "A door. Shall we go now?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04a": "That door is no more. I guess the mayfly god decided to lift a finger. Shall we remove ourselves?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_empty_town_01": "This town is long overrun.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_empty_town_02": "Pity not the dead, mayflies. Pity the prisoners instead.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_empty_town_03": "The swarm has fed well on this town.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_empty_town_04": "Pact-sworn everywhere. This is the fate of the world, preordained.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fire_cannon_01": "Let the ugly lump roar.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fire_cannon_02": "Light the fuse. Let's get this over with.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fire_cannon_03": "Set the fuse alight.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fire_cannon_04": "Gods, I cannot believe I'm condoning a cannon's use.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_elevator_01": "Mayflies! The lifting platform will carry us upward.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_elevator_02": "Perhaps we should use the lifting platform.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_elevator_03": "Mayflies and lifting platforms. What's wrong with a good rope?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_elevator_04": "Into the upper reaches, mayflies!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_entrance_01": "This place is no haven, mayflies. Not any longer.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_entrance_02": "The pact-sworn found victory here. All others found death.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_entrance_03": "An unbarred fortress is of use to neither man nor beast.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_entrance_04": "So the fort has fallen.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_help_01": "A mayfly town in ruins, and here I am, chancing my own skin.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_help_02": "Would be better if we had help, but we'll find none here.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_help_03": "Like the rest of the town, the fort is surely overwhelmed.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_help_04": "If there are mayflies in that fort, they're dead, just like everyone else.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_massacre_01": "Dead mayflies. A common sight.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_massacre_02": "Dead and done for. No helping them now, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_massacre_03": "The pact-sworn have been busy.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_fort_massacre_04": "Nothing we can do for these mayflies. We should press on.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_halfway_through_horde_01": "There's no end to them!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_halfway_through_horde_02": "Come, ratmen! By the thousand, for all I care!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_halfway_through_horde_03": "The tide flows. I hope Lohner's satisfied.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_halfway_through_horde_04": "Just once, I'd like to see Lohner stand in a place like this.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_helmgart_vista_01": "Another mayfly town in ruins.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_helmgart_vista_02": "Helmgart falls, consumed by pact-sworn.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_helmgart_vista_03": "The pact-sworn have taken Helmgart for their own.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_helmgart_vista_04": "A bleak fate for Helmgart. There is suffering wherever the ratmen cast their beady eyes.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_locked_portcullis_01": "We cannot pass through.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_locked_portcullis_02": "No way through that gate.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_locked_portcullis_03": "Gods! That gate is jammed tight!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_locked_portcullis_04": "We cannot proceed. We need another path, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_oops_01": "Good shot, mayflies. At least you hit the same bastion.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_oops_02": "Such precision. Such style. Was the gate too small a target?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_oops_03": "So much for destroying the gate.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_oops_04": "The gate still stands, but the wall has fallen. A metaphor for my life since I met you lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_pilgrim_path_01": "Did no one think to finish this path?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_pilgrim_path_02": "Just a little further, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_pilgrim_path_03": "Can you not hurry, lumberfoots?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_pilgrim_path_04": "They know we're here. I don't want to die on this ridge.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_01": "We can't climb that gate, mayflies. We need the capstan freed.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_02": "Ach, the gate is closed. Does that capstan open it?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_03": "Gods! The gate is closed. Let's hope the capstan opens it.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_04": "Kick that capstan into motion! It's our best hope with the gate.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_prepare_01": "Prepare yourselves, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_prepare_02": "No time to tarry. Gather what wits you have, and what supplies you can find.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_prepare_03": "Make ready. We'll be busy soon.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_prepare_04": "Are you prepared, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_ring_bell_01": "Right, ring the bell. Let us get this done.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_ring_bell_02": "Can we please ring the bell? I grow tired of this hovel.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_ring_bell_03": "Strike the bell, and let's begin.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_ring_bell_04": "I don't hear chimes, mayflies. Can one of you please ring the bell?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spooky_temple_01": "A clever trick, for mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spooky_temple_02": "I sense a wizard's hand in this temple.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spooky_temple_03": "Is the temple alive, or are these mere parlour tricks?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spooky_temple_04": "Takes more than a few lights to frighten me.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spotting_portal_01": "And... homeward bound we are.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spotting_portal_02": "The portal blooms for us, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spotting_portal_03": "The portal awakens. Maybe you should take heed, lumberfoots?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_spotting_portal_04": "There's the old mother's bridge. Come.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_five_01": "So this... town... is a vital part of the Empire's defences?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_five_02": "Bretonnians? Surely not?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_five_04": "Bretonnians? Superstitious greenleaves, every last one. They're endearing, and hardly frightening.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_one_01": "You've been around Goreksson for too long.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_one_02": "Raki'. You called them 'raki'.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_one_03": "Have it your way.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_ten_01": "Why think on matters you'll never witness? Why invite that sorrow?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_ten_02": "Hah! This from a dwarf. Do you think on your home?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_twelve_01": "How can you say that? The Skaven have overrun everything.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_twelve_02": "So the only thing between Helmgart and success is exchanging one set of mayflies for other, shorter mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_story_two_01": "I thought Sigmar was a presence 'ever at your shoulder'?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_temple_ahead_01": "There's the temple.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_temple_ahead_02": "That's the temple? It's somehow gaudy and plain, all at once.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_temple_ahead_03": "What pitiful god would accept such a temple?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_temple_ahead_04": "Even your temples lack charm, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_they_are_coming_01": "The pact-sworn are coming!",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_they_are_coming_02": "Happy hunting, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_they_are_coming_03": "Try not to leave all the work to me, this time.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_they_are_coming_04": "Stand firm, mayflies. They're only rats.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_time_to_leave_01": "I don't know about the pact-sworn, but I'm thoroughly distracted. Can we go?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_time_to_leave_02": "We ought to go, mayflies. Before others arrive.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_time_to_leave_03": "Stay and fight if you wish, but I've more sense.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_time_to_leave_04": "I tire of this place.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_turn_cannon_01": "I hate to suggest this... but can we not turn that crane? That cannon might serve.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_turn_cannon_02": "Ugh... Can we make use of that cannon? Turn the crane.",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_turn_cannon_03": "Set the crane moving. Perhaps that squat, ugly cannon will serve us?",
	"pwe_level_helmgart_military_turn_cannon_04": "Does the crane move? Perhaps we can try the cannon. It has to serve some purpose.",
	"pwe_level_mine_bell_ringing_01": "And now, we ring the bell.",
	"pwe_level_mine_bell_ringing_02": "Time to ring the bell, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_mine_bell_ringing_03": "Seems only fair to let the trolls know it's feeding time. Ring the bell!",
	"pwe_level_mine_bell_ringing_04": "Ring the bell, mayflies. It'll be worth it.",
	"pwe_level_mine_big_troll_cave_01": "So, here we are. Don't you wish we hadn't lost our blackfire?",
	"pwe_level_mine_big_troll_cave_02": "This would seem to be the place. That altar's a giveaway.",
	"pwe_level_mine_big_troll_cave_03": "So this is our troll-warpers' lair. It could use a good scrubbing.",
	"pwe_level_mine_big_troll_cave_04": "What a foul little abode. It'll be a pleasure to wipe it away.",
	"pwe_level_mine_darkness_01": "Black as our recent fortunes...",
	"pwe_level_mine_darkness_02": "Darkness hides much, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_mine_darkness_03": "If we die here, we'll be in good company.",
	"pwe_level_mine_darkness_04": "I don't want to die in the dark. But I certainly won't die alone.",
	"pwe_level_mine_find_explosives_01": "Blackfire. Let us gather it while we can.",
	"pwe_level_mine_find_explosives_02": "I smell blackfire. We should claim it, and put it to use.",
	"pwe_level_mine_find_explosives_03": "The sour reek of blackfire. But if it's the plan, it's the plan.",
	"pwe_level_mine_find_explosives_04": "Is that blackfire I smell? (laugh) Lohner was right. Again.",
	"pwe_level_mine_follow_tracks_01": "See those rails? Follow them.",
	"pwe_level_mine_follow_tracks_02": "We'd do well to follow the rails.",
	"pwe_level_mine_follow_tracks_03": "Those rails have to lead somewhere.",
	"pwe_level_mine_follow_tracks_04": "Where now? We could always follow the rails.",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_first_01": "And... There's the cart!",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_first_02": "I think that's our cart...",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_first_03": "Is that our cart, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_first_04": "There's our cart. Looks intact, thank the Gods.",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_troll_cave_01": "So the cart wasn't lost.",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_troll_cave_02": "I'm starting to think the cart's wiser than any of you lot.",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_troll_cave_03": "So the cart found its way here without us?",
	"pwe_level_mine_found_cart_troll_cave_04": "Is that the cart? Well, isn't that nice?",
	"pwe_level_mine_gloat_01": "(laugh) Not so threatening now, are they?",
	"pwe_level_mine_gloat_02": "(laugh) Well, they won't regenerate that mess, will they?",
	"pwe_level_mine_gloat_03": "(disgusted noise) Even more disgusting now. But at least they're dead.",
	"pwe_level_mine_impressive_cave_01": "There's a rare beauty to this cavern.",
	"pwe_level_mine_impressive_cave_02": "A cavern this majestic should not suffer the touch of Chaos.",
	"pwe_level_mine_impressive_cave_03": "This cavern should have been a wonder. Instead, it's been abused.",
	"pwe_level_mine_impressive_cave_04": "Not bad, for a hole in the ground.",
	"pwe_level_mine_ladder_01": "Quite a drop. Hold tight, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_mine_ladder_02": "If you do fall, try to land on your heads.",
	"pwe_level_mine_ladder_03": "Down, always down.",
	"pwe_level_mine_ladder_04": "One day, the world'll swallow us up, and that'll be the end of it.",
	"pwe_level_mine_lost_cart_01": "Keep going. Hopefully the cart hasn't gotten far.",
	"pwe_level_mine_lost_cart_02": "Find the cursed cart, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_mine_lost_cart_03": "Surely we're not about to abandon that blackfire?",
	"pwe_level_mine_lost_cart_04": "Where has that cart got to?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_01": "Should we take that cart along?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_02": "I suspect that cart might prove useful.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_03": "Sure, we can take the cart, but I'm not pushing you in it, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_04": "Shall we 'borrow' that cart?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_drops_away_01": "Gods! The cart's getting away!",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_drops_away_02": "Oh, well done, mayflies. There goes our blackfire.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_drops_away_03": "Well, I hope we didn't need that cart...",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_drops_away_04": "There! Are you happy now? It's gone.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_push_upwards_01": "The cart's slowing!",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_push_upwards_02": "The slope's slowing the cart!",

	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_push_upwards_04": "The cart's struggling on the slope!",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_remind_01": "Are we bringing that cart or no?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_remind_02": "Make up your mind. Do we need that cart, or not?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_remind_03": "Vengeful Drakira! Is no-one pushing the cart?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_remind_04": "Won't someone push that damn cart?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_back_01": "Aye, well done! Now we can do it all over again.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_back_02": "That cart's coming back down.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_back_03": "The cart's losing ground.",

	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_forward_01": "Run away mine cart! Fly free!",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_forward_02": "Should we not have held on to that cart, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_forward_03": "Well, looks like the cart's had enough of your company. Can't say I blame it.",
	"pwe_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_forward_04": "The cart's on the move!",
	"pwe_level_mine_portal_01": "I'd like to see them try to regenerate that, but alas, the portal's here.",
	"pwe_level_mine_portal_02": "The portal is here. Let's go, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_mine_portal_03": "Olesya wishes us to return. And so we shall.",
	"pwe_level_mine_portal_04": "Let's head to the portal. No more trolls to slay.",
	"pwe_level_mine_story_eleven_a_01": "It's true. Not just the blind, but the pox-addled as well.",

	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_04": "One more death, and we can return to the open air.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_01": "See that squalor? A warlord's nest.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_02": "We'll find our quarry in that nest, or close by.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_03": "A warlord's lair looks little different to me than Bardin's room.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_04": "The warlord seeks height, to compensate for lacking stature elsewhere.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_01": "Looks like we have our way through.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_02": "We have a path forward.",

	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_04": "The contraption has done its work. Now, let us do ours.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_01": "I saw something like this, long ago. The wheels need to be set right.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_02": "To proceed, we need to make some adjustments.",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_03": "Those big unsightly wheels... wouldn't it help if they were properly aligned?",
	"pwe_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_04": "Well, I guess we have to deal with that bloated wheel contraption, or turn back.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_01": "The gate is silent. This lever should remedy that.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_01a": "Mayflies, use the gate control Keystaff.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_02": "Look for the lever. We need that gate open, and you know it.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_02a": "Mayflies? We're here. Finally it's time to use the Keystaff.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_03": "The lever, mayflies. If I had the patience to listen to Lohner's long winded plan, so should you.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_03a": "The Keystaff goes in the panel, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_activate_gate_04": "Pull the lever, mayflies. Let's be on our way.",

	"pwe_level_skittergate_arrive_03": "Like a thousand cold claws, picking at my thoughts... then this.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_arrive_04": "Ugh.. that was unsettling... like the thought of puff pastry.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_back_home_01": "Ugh. Even worse this time... I felt my soul seeping away.",

	"pwe_level_skittergate_BOOM_01": "More merry thunder, mayflies. The gate is down for good. And I am unstoppable.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_BOOM_02": "Hah! The good news keeps coming. That gate was what everything was about, wasn't it, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_BOOM_03": "Oh, how sad! It seems the gate lost its will to live with its master plastered across the cave. What have you done, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_BOOM_04": "Well, I think the northlanders will find their invasion a touch more difficult now.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_01": "Hah, seems like they killed each other in such frenzy, they cannot even afford to guard this place?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_02": "I suppose the Warlord's demise bled their strength away. So now there are few in sight.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_03": "Without our daily routine of rat slaughter this place would seethe with foes.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_04": "So, where are you, rat-army? Oh, yes, you rats slaughtered each other just cause we killed your Warlord.",

	"pwe_level_skittergate_contol_panel_02": "Control panel, mayflies. Remember its position.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_contol_panel_03": "That's the skittergate's controls. We'll be back here, with Keystaff in hand.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_contol_panel_04": "That's the gate controls. We have a gatekeeper to put down and a Keystaff to claim.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crater_01": "Such devastation. Fit to challenge Hukon himself.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crater_02": "When the Skaven unleash their sickness on the world, the Weave always suffers.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crater_03": "A broken town. Perhaps it will rebuild, aye, but it will never be the same again.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crater_04": "This may one day be the fate of the world. The Skaven will multiply, and we will fade.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crates_01": "We should investigate those crates, perhaps?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crates_02": "Maybe the northlanders have been shipping warpstone from the Chaos Wastes?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crates_03": "We should search the dockside. Those crates may house what we need.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_crates_04": "We can't afford delay. Make for the docks. We'll search the crates.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_dead_seer_01": "Oooh! By the gods of star and shadow, that was... satisfying. Aye, I said it mayflies, I thoroughly enjoyed that. Hah!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_dead_seer_02": "Oh by the Oak... Mayflies, I can't deny it... this was worth it. The look on his mangy face!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_dead_seer_04": "And the seer's dead. About time.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_destroy_01": "I think we needed more of a plan. How do we destroy that?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_destroy_02": "So we're here. How do we destroy it? I'm waiting.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_destroy_03": "We're to destroy that? And how might we do so, exactly?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_destroy_04": "No obvious way to destroy it. We should have brought Olesya - used her cutting wit.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_docks_gate_01": "Feeling sleepy, lumberfoots? We should get inside.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_docks_gate_02": "I guess this gate could use a gatekeeper of its own. I'd gladly relieve him of his duties.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_docks_gate_03": "Mayflies? Are you waiting for an invitation? Get inside.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_docks_gate_04": "Push on. We have business inside, mayflies. Murder business.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_elevator_01": "I suppose you're too tired to walk all the way down, lumberfoots?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_elevator_02": "Are we using the lifting platform, mayflies?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_elevator_03": "The lifting platform looks like it still functions.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_elevator_04": "It's too steep to climb, the lifting platform it is.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_encampment_01": "There's an encampment in our path. Try to keep up, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_encampment_02": "We cannot afford to be slowed. We'll pass through the camp like a steel wind.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_encampment_03": "Stay close, lumberfoots. It'll be hard fighting ahead.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_encampment_04": "Northlander encampment ahead. Win or lose, let's give them a legend to remember us by.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_enter_gate_01": "This is beyond stupid. Gods save me.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_enter_gate_02": "Even for you, mayflies, this is unprecedented foolishness.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_enter_gate_03": "Suicidal tendencies, mayflies. You have them, and apparently, so do I.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_enter_gate_04": "Aye, let's just gamble away our lives, skaven technology's always a safe bet, isn't it?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_fire_gatekkeper_death_01": "Has it finally ceased its thrashing?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_fire_gatekkeper_death_02": "Stay down, scunner. Settle with two deaths today.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_fire_gatekkeper_death_03": "If only all triumphs were so complete.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_fire_gatekkeper_transform_01": "Well, that's new.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_fire_gatekkeper_transform_02": "Seems his god is none too pleased. Fight on, mayflies!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_fire_gatekkeper_transform_03": "The body writhes to match a corrupt soul. It'll die, all the same.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_follow_01": "We'll have to go through the skittergate.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_follow_02": "Lileath help me, but we'll have to go through the gate.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_follow_03": "And where's he off to? We'd better follow.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_follow_04": "The ratman flees! What a surprise. But we'll catch him yet, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_01": "Primitive vessels, but dangerous enough.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_02": "One hawkship from Ulthuan, and those northlanders would learn a valuable lesson.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_03": "Look at those hulks. Northlanders are as clumsy on the waves as they are on dry land.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_04": "See those ships? The first of many, if we fail.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_01": "Just another braggart scunner, stampeding towards certain death.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_02": "Kill him quick, lumberfoots. This one bores me worse than Kruber and Bardin debating the finer points of billygoat-wrestling.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_03": "Does he think he's the first scunner whose tedium we've had to endure?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_04": "I'm sorry, did he say something worth heeding?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_01": "No challenge at all. Where's the Keystaff?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_02": "He's down. Grab the Keystaff. We've more to do.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_03": "He's dead, mayflies. We should take the Keystaff and go.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_04": "Ignore that pile of putrid flesh. Take the Keystaff.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gate_activated_01": "It's alive. May we not regret that.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gate_activated_02": "That did it, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gate_activated_03": "Aye, it's waking up. A good sign, or no?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_gate_activated_04": "It's alive. How fortunate... for Lohner.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_01": "We have what we need. Back to the gate controls. And with haste, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_02": "It's time to go mayflies. To the gate controls.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_03": "Well, Olesya's delivered so far. To the gate controls, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_04": "That key staff's nothing but dead weight until we reach the gate controls. Hurry mayflies",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_01": "Right. Now we just need to upset the warp regulators...",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_02": "Now, let's convince this disgusting contraption to overheat.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_03": "As Olesya uncovered, this machine gets hot. Time to encourage it, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_04": "The warp regulators, mayflies. They need vandalising... oh, just like Olesya needs Kruber! Haha!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_leave_01": "Time to move, lumberfoots. I'm not keen on falling rocks.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_leave_02": "We're done and I need some fresh air. Not rocks falling on my head.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_leave_03": "Time to go, mayflies. before a cave-in dampens the mood.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_leave_04": "Right. That's it, I'm leaving, with or without you. Have a nice cave-in!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_01": "Can we get that gate open?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_02": "A wooden barricade shouldn't hold us back.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_03": "We need this gate open.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_04": "You may like it on this side of the gate, mayflies. I do not.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_01": "Don't target the Seer! Aim for the Stormfiend!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_02": "Remember the Seer's shield? He still has it, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_03": "Concentrate your efforts on the Stormfiend, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_04": "He's hiding behind his magic! Focus on his mount!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_05": "Don't waste your efforts on the Seer when his shield is up! Soften up the Stormfiend!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_06": "Fight the Stormfiend, not Rasknitt! When his shield is down, I'm melting eyeballs!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_07": "The seer's shield is up! We have the big juicy target of the Stormfiend to focus on!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_08": "Let the Stormfiend have it! No use engaging the shielded bastard riding it.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_09": "It's a bit too much of everything to live, darlings! Bring down the Stormfiend!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_10": "The Stormfiend, darlings. Show it how much we love it.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_01": "Yes! The Seer's open for attack! Go get him! Get him good!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_02": "Seer's not in the saddle, lumberfoots. Make the most of it!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_03": "Down went Rasknitt, foulest of the foul! Make him pay for everything, mayflies!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_04": "The Seer's unprotected! Shoot him in the snout!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_05": "Shield is down, darlings. The Seer's ripe for plucking. One stab for every person he's killed.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_06": "Opportunity, darlings! Shieldless seer!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_07": "Seer's defence dropped, darlings! Who's with me ganging up on him?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_08": "No shield on the Seer! We all want payback, darlings! This is the time!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_big_incoming_01": "This might be interesting. Even you mayflies can't miss that lumbering.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_big_incoming_02": "I sounds like the Grey Seer has... Over compensated.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_reply_01": "Is he finished with that ear-sore rant? It's been a long day.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_reply_02": "Now this is convenient. I feared we would have to track down this craven lice-rat after all this.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_01": "The seer-rat won't like it if we hit him when he's casting, mayflies! Do it!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_02": "If you want less dark magic coming your way, hit him hard as he casts!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_03": "Make the seer-rat think about pain instead of magic! Interrupt his casting!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_04": "Watch out for his magic! If we hit him enough, he won't have the time to cast!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_01": "Interfering? This is just a game to me, seer.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_02": "Talk, talk, talk. When do we get to the killing?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_03": "I'm an elf. Interference is like breathing to us.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_04": "Oh, are we interrupting? Sorry.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_01": "You mistake me for someone who cares what you think.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_02": "I'm sorry, were you talking to me?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_03": "Go on, puff out your chest. Maybe that'll be more convincing.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_04": "Words are easy, seer. Have you actions to back them up?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_stormfiend_dead_01": "Aye, so big, so armoured, so armed, and so dead! Hah!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_stormfiend_dead_02": "See that, seer-rat? No pets allowed!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_01": "Move, lumberfoots! If the rat gets away again, someone's paying for it!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_02": "Don't lose the seer-rat, lumberfoots! Move!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_03": "Move, lumberfoots! Don't let him escape!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_04": "Keep up with him, mayflies! Don't let him get away again!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_replace_power_01": "Get the warpstone in place.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_replace_power_02": "Set that cursed rock in position.",

	"pwe_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_02": "Go! Through the skittergate! Keep up or be left for dead, lumberfoots!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_03": "Fight your way to the gate! Go!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_04": "Make for the gate! Let nothing stand in your way!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_01": "Hah! Wreck, smash and break to your hearts desire, mayflies. ",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_02": "Come on lumberfoots, are the regulators too agile for you?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_03": "Aye, these look fragile enough. A few good blows ought to destroy them.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_04": "Shatter the regulators, lumberfoots, and then be ready to run!",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_01": "Gatekeeper! Show yourself! We'll make it a quick and painful death.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_02": "Where's this scunner hiding? See any holes large enough for this bog-brained oaf?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_03": "Search the camp, mayflies. We need the gatekeeper's treasure.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_04": "Oh, we humbly seek your audience, Gatekeeper. We bring lavish gifts and a very generous offer.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_ships_01": "Primitive vessels, but dangerous enough.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_ships_02": "One hawkship from Ulthuan, and those northlanders would learn a valuable lesson.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_ships_03": "Look at those hulks. Northlanders are as clumsy on the waves as they are on dry land.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_ships_04": "See those ships? The first of many, if we fail.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_01": "That's the skittergate, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_02": "There it is. Vile thing.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_03": "Skittergate's in sight, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_04": "That repulsive contraption, mayflies, that is our target.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_01": "Olesya's done well. There's the docks and the back door, just as promised.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_02": "The Docks. That's where we find the entrance. Just as well. My waning patience won't tolerate anything else.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_03": "There's our path in, lumberfoots. Hurry along now.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_04": "No inescapable death-traps yet. Seems like Olesya's still coherent and able.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_01": "The Gatekeeper has the Keystaff. We won't find either whilst loitering here, mayflies.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_02": "There was talk of a gatekeeper, and to pique my interest, talk of killing said gatekeeper. I approve.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_03": "We'll need to find the gatekeeper if we want his Keystaff. See? I do listen to Lohner. Sometimes.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_04": "We need the Keystaff, mayflies, so find the gatekeeper, or lay down and die. Your choice.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_eight_01": "That seems a bit, capricious, even for you.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_eight_02": "I suppose not. We are all true to our natures... and our addictions.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_one_01": "Are we ready for this, mayflies? The whole of the Reikland teeters on our actions.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_one_02": "I can't help what you hear, sergeant. But I do take pride in a job well done.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_six_01": "Did you see that seer, mocking us again?",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_six_02": "He locked me up. I'll have his pelt for that.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_ten_01": "It's only a taste of what's to come.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_ten_02": "Know? I don't 'know' anything. But I fear for the future.",

	"pwe_level_skittergate_story_twelve_02": "Was that... a joke? From you? Truly, this is the End Times come upon us.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_01": "Aye! Yes, let's show them how the most puerile of idiots do it, not once, but twice in a day.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_02": "This had better be the only way. If parts of me go missing, Lohner will pay with parts of his own.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_03": "Oh, I'm sure it'll be even more pleasant this time. mayflies. And still a genius plan.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_04": "So, fortune favours the fool. I'd say you first, mayfly, but I've no time for lumberfooting.",
	"pwe_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_01": "Hah, and just like skaven dreams, the pit collapses.",

	"pwe_portals_pwe_castle_vista_03": "Evil has an aspect all of its own, does it not?",

Maybe then I can put the place behind me for good.",
	"pwe_st_castle_briefing_02": "Castle Drachenfels has become a Rotblood lair, and I've a wee notion that we shouldn't let some fat, arrogant sorcerer have the run of the place. There are perils enough within those stones already, and we've trouble enough without encouraging more.",

	"pwe_st_crater_loading_screen_02": "A meteor crashed last night. Lohner thinks it's trouble. I agree, for the Weave is restless ... and that means warpstone. Much as I'd rather stay far away, we'll have to take a look. It'll only be trouble if the ratmen get ahold of it.",

	"pwe_st_loading_screen_bell_02": "The ratmen have raised a bell on Helmgart's walls. Might be a Screaming Bell. It might not. Either way, I agree with Lohner - the scunnered thing will have to come down, if only so we can have a little bit of peace and quiet.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_catacombs_01": "If ever there was a place that shouldn't stink of dark magic, it's a Shallyan hospice. What are the Pactsworn up to down there? I suppose there's nothing for it but to go and take a wee look, and remonstrate, where appropriate.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_catacombs_02": "The Pactsworn are causing mischief in a mayfly hospice. Presumably because picking on those who can fight back is beyond their meagre reserves of courage. Isn't it a shame that we're onto them?",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_cemetary_01": "The Weave is shuddering - the ratmen are brewing vile poison in Morr's Field. It's only a matter of time before it spreads, so for once Lohner and I find ourselves in accord as to what must be done. The 'what' being put an end to the ratman mischief. Permanently.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_cemetary_02": "The ratmen are brewing poison in the Garden of Morr. Likely they're using mayfly corpses to do it, which is thrify of the wee scunners if nothing else. But it remains an affront to the Weave, so they won't be making their concoctions for much longer.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01": "The northlanders are very unhappy with our recent deeds. It's so nice when one's efforts are appreciated, don't you think? Their chief - with the ridiculous name of Bödvarr Ribspreader - is looking for our keep. He'll have to be dissuaded. Permanently.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02": "Bödvarr Ribspreader. Bödvarr Ribspreader? For that name alone he deserves to die. And die he will. Not for his ridiculous name - more's the pity - but for trying to locate Taal's Horn Keep. We can't have that, so let the bloody remonstration begin.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_crawl_01": "Lohner's insisting we all head into Helmgart for a wee drink. I've nothing against that, not as such, but why do I have to do it in the company of mayflies? Oh well, I suppose there's no avoiding it. At least I can show the other how an elf maid holds her drink. That'll put them in their place.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_crawl_02": "Helmgart is quiet - at least for the moment. That much is fine. The problem is, Lohner's decided we need to have what he refers to as 'a bit of quality downtime' by which he means I should go drinking with the mayflies. Why, I ask you, would I want to do that?",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01": "Lohner's had word from a Father Kraussman, insisting that the Bögenhafen plague is due to a Chaos runesword, which we will have to retrieve if the town's to be spared. Don't we just get all of the nice jobs? I mean, would anyone miss Bögenhafen?",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02": "So it appears that the trouble in Bögenhafen's down to a Chaos runesword. We're to seize the scunnered thing and get it somewhere safe. All well and good - I suppose - but I've a foreboding that it'll mean trudging through a sewer. Again.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01": "Bögenhafen is in the grips of a plague, and Lohner's convinced it's the work of the Pactsworn. Maybe he's right, maybe he's not, but there's no way to know for certain until we have a wee look around the place. You never know ...",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02": "Apparently there's plague in Bögenhafen. Lohner, not realising that there's plague everywhere, wants us to investigate. I'll be honest, I don't want to... but what would happen to the mayflies if I stayed behind? Nothing good.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01": "The bridge of shadows isn't working as it should, so Olesya wants us to head to Athel Yenlui and put an end to the interference. I ... don't know that I want to go. Too many memories waiting to be stirred up. Too many regrets.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02": "Mother Olesya's bridge of shadows is experiencing problems. She's tracked the interference back to the ruined temple of Athel Yenlui, and we're to investigate. I wonder if it'll feel like being back home? As if I care.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_farmland_01": "The Pactsworn can't handle a proper fight, so now they're going after terrified peasants. Worthless scunners! I suspect we'll get there too late to do much good, but we can at least register our disapproval in the severest of terms.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_farmland_02": "The Pactsworn are terrorising the farms around Ussingen. As much as I've little sympathy for mayflies who can't be bothered to learn to wield a sword, I find it all strangely annoying. Still, I'll feel better when the blood starts flowing and the screaming begins.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01": "The ratmen are up to something out in the forest, clamouring night and day to make their ramshackle war machines. Lohner says we should go out there and destroy them. Well, I say that surely beats staying here listening to Goreksson's singing. ",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02": "We've been told that the ratmen are building war engines out in the forest. Well, we can't have that, can we? Another mission for Kerillian the Extraordinarily Heroic and her mayfly companions. Assuming they don't get themselves killed.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_fort_01": "What if a handful of mayflies have gotten themselves trapped in Fort Brachsenbrücke? It's hardly my concern. Or it shouldn't be. But if I don't agree to go, Lohner will try that 'reverse psychology' of his again, and the poor man looks so pathetic that I'll start laughing at him. Again.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_fort_02": "A mayfly fort is under siege by the Pactsworn. I keep telling Lohner that we're not exactly short of mayflies, but he insists we help the defenders out of the mess they've landed themselves in. I suppose it's as good a place as any to make partial amends for Hoggar's Bridge.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_ground_zero_01": "Lohner's spinning a tale of a Rotblood sorcerer making trouble in Helmgart's ruins. I have generously decided to go along and end the scunner's foul existence. Someone's got to show the mayflies how it's done.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_ground_zero_02": "A Rotblood sorcerer is making trouble in Helmgart. I say the town's beyond saving anyway, but Lohner - foolish mayfly that he is - doesn't agree. I suppose I could sit this one out, but the others would only get themselves killed. ",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01": "Olesya has gone into Helmgart to spy on the ratmen, and we're to create a distraction to make her life easier. So off to the Temple of Sigmar we go to ring out the bells. What can possibly go wrong with that? How long have you got?",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02": "Lohner wants us to cause a distraction. I suggested stripping Saltzpyre naked and hanging him from the city walls, but apparently that was a bit…too much. Instead, we're going to ring the bells at the Temple of Sigmar. Oh well, maybe next time.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01": "Why did I ever come to Ubersreik? There are rats everywhere, and now the city's under siege. Brilliant. Just brilliant! These mayflies have begged me to help them sound the alarm, and I've agreed. Twice the fool, I suppose. Still, at least it won't be boring.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02": "Ubersreik's under attack - as if I care - but I suppose there's no harm killing a few marauding ratmen. These mayflies are sure to make a botch of it without me. We're off to the Horn of Magnus to sound the alarm, but I'm sure I'll be doing all the work.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_mines_01": "Is there no end to the northlanders' vile deeds? Trolls are foul enough without anyone splicing them with sorcery or daemons or whatever madcap scheme they've settled upon. They all have to die. What a shame. What a terrible, terrible, terrible shame.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_mines_02": "The northlanders are breeding trolls down in an abandoned mine. Full points for ingenuity, if not for taste. Still, we can't have the brutish things wandering around, can we? The hard part will be to stop Goreksson cooking the remains, mark my words.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_nurgle_01": "We go to the nicest places. This time it's a swamp, where the Rotbloods are excavating a vile and ancient idol. I suppose we'd better do something about it, otherwise I'll never hear the end of it. At least it can't smell worse than the dwarf.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_nurgle_02": "[Disgusted noise]. The Rotbloods are digging around in the swamp. Now, you'd think it's the best place for them - and you'd be right - but Lohner says they're looking to harness the power of an ancient monolith. Can't have that.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01": "The dwarfs, alas, have allowed the hold of Karak Gnol to fall into skaven hands. Careless. Very, very careless. So it's up to us to set matters right, and issue notice of eviction, inked in ratman blood. Another one Goreksson's going to owe me, but who's keeping count? Apart from me, obviously.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02": "Dwarf holds attract all manner of vile, squalid creatures with aspirations of competence - starting, of course, with the dwarfs themselves. Karak Gnol, however, lies in the hands of a skaven warlord who needs to be quietly dislodged from this sphere of existence.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_skittergate_01": "If Lohner's to be believed, the Skittergate's no longer guarded so closely as to make a direct assault a suicide mission, which I suppose is for the best. There'll be no peace until we destroy the foul contraption, and I so long for a bit of peace and quiet.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_skittergate_02": "The ratmen are using one of their vile contraptions to keep reinforcements flooding in from the frozen north, and I for one am quite sick of it. So we're going to go up there  and ask them politely to desist. And then we're going to break their toy to little pieces.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_ussingen_01": "The Rotbloods have seized Ussingen, and are even now using the Baron's manor as a storehouse for their plundered provisions. That's right - everything's in one place, just waiting to be burned, blown up or otherwise spoiled. This one ought to be fun.",
	"pwe_st_loading_screen_ussingen_02": "It would appear that the northlanders, having a slender grip on practicalities such as 'logistics' and 'provisions' have filled the Baron's manor to the rafters with food supplies. Can't have that, can we? It'll all have to burn.",
	"pwe_st_objective_cemetery_bringing_down_fourth_attachment_02": "Get out of the way, meat!",
	"pwe_st_objective_goal_achieved_more_left_12": "It's only a start, meat. We've more yet.",

	"pwe_st_portals_briefing_01": "The Pactsworn - never ones to shy for cowardly deeds - are stealing folk from the villages around Castle Drachenfels. Will they never learn? Sienna's all for intervening, and so am I. For kidnappers should never prosper.",
	"pwe_st_portals_briefing_02": "Castle Drachenfels. Lileath, but I'd hoped never to hear that name again, however the Pactsworn are making free with the local villagers, and I feel an overpowering urge to offer the chastisement of blade and bow. So, let the hunt begin.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_eighteen_01": "You still don't understand, do you? I am what I always was, only moreso. I am myself, unbounded by the whims of meat.",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_eight_01": "You do know we're talking about the High Elf Everqueen?",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_eight_02": "They would slice you to tiny pieces and cast them, away, into the sea.",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_fifteen_01": "The gods? Aye, maybe. The goddesses? No. They nurse a grudge like you wouldn't believe, and it makes them mighty.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_fifteen_02": "Oh good. That's a weight off my mind.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_five_01": "Meat and their allegiances! Aye, some of us are bound to Isha. But we're free to worship as we wish, and Isha ...",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_fourteen_01": "Did I make a mistake Goreksson? Becoming what I am?",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_fourteen_02": "Aye, but you do make a lot of mistakes. In this, if nowhere else, I'd value your counsel.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_four_01": "How many times? I'm not part tree. I'm one with the forest and the Weave. A herald of Cadai and Cytharai. It's different.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_four_02": "Hah! The hypocrisy of meat! Or was that not a schematic for a mechanical arm I saw in your workshop.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_nineteen_01": "How very generous ... Could it be that you're tempted by the truths I've seen?",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_nineteen_02": "Aye, dignity. So important. You mustn't feel ashamed that I intrigue you.",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_seventeen_01": "Believe what you will, and chance the consequences. I am beyond such concerns.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_seventeen_02": "My eyes are open as never before. I suggest you leave it at that.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_seven_01": "Will you not leave it well alone, meat?",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_seven_02": "[Sigh of Defeat] She's dead. An interloper stole all that made her who she was.",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_sixteen_02": "Just assume everything's a little bit closer to the surface now  ... and sleep lightly.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_six_01": "No. You were talking about Isha. I was casually deflecting.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_six_02": "She is ... Not what she was. She's not even who she was.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_ten_01": "As I've said many times before - so many times - I'm not part tree. I'm part of the forest.",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_three_01": "So he sends one obsessive to fix another? I'm not a machine to be repaired, Goreksson. ",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_three_02": "You're a good friend. I'll try to remember that. If I'm allowed.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twelve_01": "Leave me be, Goreksson. I've had my fill of your questions.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twelve_02": "Aye. Maybe. I don't know any longer. I don't know what it all means.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentyfive_01": "And from whence hails your knowledge, might I ask?",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentyfive_02": "Aye. There's many a man happier for thinking we're all helpless wee butterfly maidens. But some of us bite.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentyfour_01": "All is as it should be. Hekarti grants me the power, Atharti the will to see it used. Isha's memory binds me to the Weave and Lileath's love to the Light. And the Morai-Heg keeps the balance.",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentythree_01": "I know what you're thinking, Sienna, but Atharti isn't evil. She's the Goddess of Desire.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentythree_02": "That's a misunderstanding. Surely you approve of her sister Hekarti? ",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentythree_03": "Look, she doesn't kill people. She just knows when they're going to die ... and very occasionally speeds it along.",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twentytwo_01": "Are any of us?",
	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_twenty_01": "Is that outrage I hear? Or jealousy? ... Or temptation? ",

	"pwe_st_woods_conversation_two_01": "I ... I'm sorry, Kruber. Truly. What I am now ... it's like the best of what I used to be, and the worst. Does that make any sense to you?",
