You remember how I’ve commissioned a local lass to immortalise your deeds? \\n\\nNo?\\n\\nWell, then you should pay more attention, shouldn’t you?\\n\\nAnyway, this lass – name of Catrinne – she’s on her way up to the keep, when she’s jumped by a pack of skaven. Don’t worry, she’s alright. Thing about skirts is they’re good for hiding knives, and Catrinne’s got as many knives as she has paintbrushes.\\n\\nThing is, she took something strange off one of the corpses. A trinket of dwarfen make, by the looks of things – a lodestone. Catrinne gave it to me, Olesya nicked it out of my quarters… and, well, she thinks it’s important. \\n\\nI told her that you found it, by the way. She doesn’t much like Catrinne.\\n\\nCutting to the chase, Olesya says it’s got something to do with Ubersreik. With me so far, or have you forgotten that as well? Good. She doesn’t know what, of course. Only that there are three dwarfen runes hidden about the place that serve as the key to its hiding place.\\n\\nNow, we can’t very well go back to Ubersreik. Even if we weren’t up to our eyes in it over here, half of the place is in ruins by now. Could be our runes have gone to wherever it is runes go when they die.

This extravagant hat (thought to have at one time earned the current Emperor’s unfading envy) is said to be the least of Friedhelm’s sartorial delights.

Not only are its enchantments founded on the principle of ‘quantity’ rather than ‘accuracy’, it overheats at a prodigious rate. More than one battle has turned for the worse following a Bright Wizard’s sudden explosion, and the immolation of their nearby allies.

On the other hand, life-expectancy is seldom better in confined spaces if a troll is present, and to be an ironbreaker is to make selfless decisions for the good of the hold. Thanks to Bardin’s tinkering, his Trollhammers are easier to carry and marginally less self-destructive – a boon for the rest of the Ubersreik Five.\\n",
	"lore_es_deus_01": "The spear and shield may be humble, but it has many times been pivotal in the defence of not only the Empire, but many distant realms. Any fool can wield such a pairing – and indeed many have – but it takes years of skill and training to unlock the full potential of reach and defence that the combination enables. A dedicated spearman can best a far larger and stronger foe, so long as his weapons remain true.\\nIn the Empire, the spear is perhaps the most common of all weapons, save for the iconic halberd, and no mercenary worth his salt would dare claim himself a true soldier unless he has mastered it. \\n",
	"lore_huntsman_hat_1006": "Crafted from the remains of a shark that notoriously brought horror to the Marienburg harbour some years back, this headgear is surprisingly durable. It’s also surprisingly odorous, possessing a fishy stench that can curdle milk from several dozen yards upwind. \\nCuriously, immersion in water only makes the smell worse, as Kruber discovered when taking a swim in the River Bögen (for entirely mischievous purposes). Alas, forewarned – and not a little sickened – by the stench, the villagers fled for the safety of upwind climes, making the prank fall a little flat. All might have been well had that same aroma not lured a river troll out of its waterside cave, leading to the weaponless Kruber’s hasty and ignominious retreat. To add insult to injury, Sienna and Kerillian have since immortalised events in a brief but poignant romantic play, whose performance has been wholeheartedly embraced by the Bögen fisherfolk.\\n",
	"lore_ironbreaker_hat_1004": "While no dwarf will actually admit to an outsider of feeling self-conscious about their height, they often – and quite by coincidence – spend vast sums on hats designed to, ahem, increase their standing. As a result, Dwarfen battle-millinery is a fiercely competitive business, leading to some quite extraordinary designs. \\nThis particular piece, commissioned by Torri Gretson from the renowned Barak Varr smith Kreng Krengisson, was something of a legend in its day, and the tale was only enhanced further when Gretson’s heirs fell to squabbling over their father’s vanished helm. In the resulting unpleasantness, one fell off Steercrag Mountain, another took the Slayer Oath and the third left Barak Varr forever, never to be seen again. \\nBut the helm, at least, survives, kept safe by Gretson’s daughter Emalda, to whom it had secretly been bequeathed.\\n",
	"lore_knight_hat_0011": "Now that is a fine look, and no mistake. The noble brow, the stern features, and the picturesque scar left by the business end of a … I want to say ‘bear’, but around here, who knows? Frankly, I wouldn’t put it past Catrinne – she’s got a fearsome temper on her, and no impulse control. Always a bad combination. Not so practical in battle, I fear. That is, unless you’re relying on some fiendishly good looks to stop the enemy cold? Might work, I guess, but I reckon I’ll stick to a nice, solid steel helm. It’s served me well enough in the past.",
	"lore_maidenguard_hat_1004": "Ellyrian Reavers rove the wild lands of Ellyrion, slaying the monstrous beasts that leave the borders of the Annulii and seek to rampage through the Inner Kingdoms. Many a Cockatrice or Chimera has been laid low by the well-placed arrows or spear thrusts of the noble youths, and many more Dark Elves have had their cruel raids cut short. \\nIndeed, such pride do the Ellyrian Reavers take in their kills that many keep a tally of slain foes. When the sun sets and the fighting ceases, she whose spear has felled the greatest number of enemies is granted the honour of carrying the regiment's standard into the next battle. However, she who slays the mightiest opponent receives Kurnous' favour; when next she rides to war she does so as one of Kurnous' Harbingers, blessed with peerless aim by the wild god of the hunt.",
	"lore_mercenary_hat_1002": "It is well known in some quarters that the Emperor Karl-Franz is incredibly fond of hats. At least, so Kruber insists. \\nA topic Kruber is rather more vague on is how this particularly fine specimen escaped the Emperor’s personal vaults and came to Taal’s Horn Keep. But get him drunk enough – a non-inconsequential investment – and he’ll regale listeners with a story. Apparently, Marshal Erich Ludenwald, upon finding his life saved by a much younger – and soberer – Kruber, promised the young lad his prized hat as a reward. \\nAlas that very afternoon, Ludenwald found himself on the wrong end of an Orc’s choppa. Unaware (or uncaring) of pledges made, the Emperor claimed the splendid hat as a memento of his old friend… an injustice some unknowable and unseen hand has clearly righted.\\n",
	"lore_scholar_hat_1002": "All wizards have a fondness for candles. Spellcraft can be a challenging matter at the best of times, and a thousand cautionary tales warn against the rashness of sifting somatic components in the dark. Especially when one is an adept of Aqshy, and the difference between flammable and fireproof can prove a matter of life or attention-grabbing death. \\nThis particular collar was fashioned with safety in mind. The candles themselves are made from rendered dragon fat, and thus incredibly resistant to flame. When lit, they have a smell some describe as ‘burning history’ which, given the often great age of the dragons slain to make such candles a reality, can be said to be more literal statement that it first appears. \\nCertainly, dragons have no trouble recognising the aroma, meaning that while the bearer need fear no darkness, they might very well be advised to wariness of what lingers therein.\\n",
	"lore_scholar_hat_1003": "Bright Wizards are not especially known for their love of finery and flummeries, for such things are invariably the first to burn when the flames turn wrathful. Even so, one or two do invest in ostentatious fashion – though this, by its nature, is somewhat unique to their explosive calling.\\nThis particular helm is one such item, fashioned largely of glass to avoid metal’s well-documented interference with the magical arts. One happy side effect is that the myriad fiery reflections cause the helm’s facets to sparkle like gemstone, creating a pleasing display from little more than a Bright Wizard’s natural tendency to, shall we say, let off steam. Such crowns are particularly sought after, though not without risk. Should the glass grow too hot, the panels have a tendency to shatter … with unfortunate results for those nearby.\\n",
	"lore_shade_hat_1002": "Walk softly through the Ashen Hills. Such is the warning given to those who tread the barren wastes of Naggaroth. Even in that most dangerous of lands, the Ashen Hills hold a reputation for perils uncounted, for the vicious web of predators and prey has honed its denizens to the most vicious of killers. \\nNowhere is this truer among the outcast Shades of that province, who were blinded long ago in one of Malekith’s splendid fits of pique. Distrusted and unloved, even by their own kin, the druchii of the Ashen Hills delight in the stalking of prey. Unable to see, they track their victims by the sound of footfalls, and are seldom seen in return. At least, not before a wicked blade takes their victim’s throat or slips between their ribs… and by then, it’s rather too late.\\n",
	"lore_skin_bw_myrmidia": "In her aspect of the Goddess of Civilisation, Myrmidia tasks her faithful to uphold the precepts of law, for civilisation is nothing without such foundations. Her judges are unflinching in the pursuance of this duty. In criminal matters, they pay no heed to rank or wealth – there is only perpetrator, and victim. For though it is oft-forgotten, Myrmidia also holds herself to be a patron of the honourable, not merely the valiant.\\nAccordingly, Myrmidia’s judges are crossed only by the very arrogant or the very foolish. Both end the same way. The Goddess has little truck with dissembling and deception, and thus guilt or innocence are her judges’ only concerns. Fortunately, ashes seldom quibble about the severity of sentence.",
	"lore_skin_dr_irondrake": "Unsurprisingly, a good many ironbreakers revere Valaya above the other Ancestor Gods. After all, it falls to them to protect a hold’s hidden under-roads from the dwarfs’ most tenacious foes, selling their lives dearly against overwhelming numbers. This is a calling that comes from within, for there is little glory in the darkness, and few will ever know the mighty deeds performed within its grasp. \\nIndeed, ironbreakers perhaps best represent Valaya’s calling of ‘peace through war’ than any other cadre of dwarfs. Where their kin might fight for glory, for wealth or in the prosecution of old grudges, ironbreakers hold hearth and home precious above all. Such dedication is a virtue close to Valaya’s generous heart, and it is said that ale never tastes sweeter than in the darkness, surrounded by one’s doughty comrades.",
	"lore_skin_es_longshark": "Is it said that in the depths of the Great Forest, King Taal – the God of the Wilds and the Lord of Beasts – holds court. This is untrue, for Taal sees little need to trouble himself with the trappings of civilisation or worldly protocol. Nonetheless, there are those who consider themselves his heralds in the wider world. \\nSuch individuals are rare, but are welcomed to hovel and hearth across Talabecland and Stirland, where their arrival is viewed as proof of Taal’s favour, and a promise of bountiful hunting in the days ahead. Indeed, should such a village stand imperilled, once such Herald of Taal might even arrive to fight in its defence. Taal may be apart from civilisation, but he seldom forgets his faithful.\\n",
	"lore_skin_es_mercenary_1001": "Mercenaries like to stand out from the crowd, and the previous owner of this particular ensemble more than most. Though the garb is tattered and torn, the heraldry of many armies and mercenary bands can be glimpsed amid its rags … or so it appears. The truth is, this is no motley assemblage crafted by chance, but the remnant of a uniform deliberately commission by someone lacking either the good sense he was born with, or a pair of functioning eyes. \\nNonetheless, the uniform does make the wearer linger in the mind’s eye, if only out of pity. Once the Hellequin is glimpsed, it is not easily forgotten. It may, indeed, be the very thing Kruber is looking for (being the shy, self-effacing gent that he is…)\\n",
	"lore_skin_wh_bountyhunter_1001": "Of all the items in Lohner’s shop, there’s something about this one that just … catches the eye. Maybe it’s the cut of the fabric, the sheen of the silk. The lace ruff, perhaps? Or the gilded edging that sparkles like the sun? It is a masterwork of haberdashery, as impressive in its way as the toughest ironbreaker’s plate, or the delicate fletching on an elven arrow. It doesn't belong in this world, and its implicit promise is that if you wear it, nor will you … and everyone will know it.\\nBut the greatest mystery of all – one that takes cruel injustice to new heights – is the fact that this wonderous garb fits no one so perfectly as Victor Saltzpyre, who considers fine garb second only to bathing in the pursuit of hedonistic mores…\\n",
	"lore_skin_wh_flagellant": "So many years have passed since Sigmar ascended to godhood that it is almost impossible to understand how a barbarian king famed for his wisdom and valour has spawned a religion based on madness and degradation. And yet, this is precisely what has happened, for none worship Sigmar so fervently as those willing to surrender themselves to cleansing pain.\\nFlagellants despair of a world sliding into sin and heresy, and buttress their own faltering will through the application of the brand, and the lash. Pain, they believe, brings not only clarity, but fortitude – even godliness. Nothing scares such men. After all, what can the enemy possibly do to them that they have not already done to themselves?\\n",
	"lore_skin_ww_moonmantle": "Priestesses of Lileath hold a revered position in Ulthuani and Asrai societies, but also a distrusted one. Their motives – like those of their goddess – are not always as transparent as others might wish. While it is accorded a great honour to have a priestess attend the birth of a child or the coronation of a monarch, there is always a lingering suspicion as to what exactly the significance of her gifts – and her words – might hold.\\nNo such doubts are present, however, if a priestess of Lileath deigns to join a battle line. There is only the certainty that the struggle to come is somehow pivotal in the elven race’s long battle for survival. Where walks a priestess, Lileath’s gaze is sure to follow.\\n",
	"lore_skin_ww_shade_1001": "The commission, fulfilment and expectation of assassination are merely a facet of daily life in the realm of Naggaroth. One must be forever alert for the possibility a rival – or even a chance acquaintance – judging your survival less valuable than the quantity of coin its curtailment will cost. Assassins themselves are therefore common to the point of expendability, and commissions jealously contested by whatever advantage can be sought.\\nGarb is one such advantage. Naggarothi assassins favour raiment that moves easily, presents the wearer with a degree of enviable style – on those few occasions where she wishes to be seen – and above all, blends with the shadows. This particular ensemble – until recently – belonged to a traveller come seeking Lohner. Kerillian intercepted him before contact could be made, and has since taken pains to keep Lohner ignorant of his almost-brush with death…\\n",
	"lore_we_deus_01": "The Moonfire Bow is a gift from Lileath herself, an enchanted weapon that summons arrows of cold, blue flame to vanquish the wielder’s enemies. As one might expect from a godly weapon, it requires no mortal arrows to fire – though it does take a toll of the user’s willpower each time an arrow is loosed. By concentrating on the target, the wielder can even summon forth a mightier shot!\\nAs with all of Lileath’s gifts, whatever purpose the Moonfire Bow serves for its wielder, it doubtless serves the goddess threefold. The Druchii of Naggaroth, who have little love for Lileath, believe that such gifts hold a subtle, insidious influence over the wielder, directing them to means and ends of which the Goddess approves. Then again, the Druchii have never much approved of anything subtle or insidious that is not their own doing …\\n",
	"lore_wh_deus_01": "The Griffon-Foot is a rare and oft-derided invention, expensive to forge, a daemon to maintain and slow to reload. On the other hand, it packs ferocious firepower across a wide area, making death – or at least a powerful bellyache – inevitable for all who are caught in its path. \\nFortunately, the slow reload can be mitigated by carrying several fully-loaded Griffon-foot pistols and simply switching to another whenever one is spent. This makes for an expensive proposition – rare as they are, only a fellow with prodigious wealth or far-reaching contacts would be fortunate enough to lay his hands on more than a single weapon. That Saltzpyre has managed this feat shows unusual reach. Perhaps Lohner is the responsible party?\\n",
