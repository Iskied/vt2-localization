A well timed Flamestorm spell made a grand bonfire of the approaching wall of rotting flesh, and the battle was finally won with a devastating flanking charge from the Knights Panther.",
	"description_bw_gate_0008": "This Guard is something truly special, if the High Elf merchant who supplied the Hydra teeth can be held to his word. The natural habitat of the Hydra is Naggaroth, the land of the Dark Elves, and any materials or parts from the flame breathing beast are therefore an utmost rarity in the Old World. The Dark Elves breed War Hydras, but the fangs used in the creation of this headgear are allegedly from a wild specimen.",

	"description_bw_gate_0010": "Sienna's last foray into Ubersreik was quite eventful, if the Burgomeister Ernst Maler is to be believed. A mill and a textile factory were burnt down, and among the victims was his elder son, Dieter Maler. Some people wonder about the fact that the disappearances of street children stopped after the arson.

Its previous owner, a fellow Ostland Swordsman, was fortunately wise enough to clearly mark the helmet with Imperial insignia to avoid being mistaken for the enemy on the battlefield. \\n\\nPirazzo's Lost Legion shot to fame as the only survivors of the Lustrian expedition funded by the merchants of Tobaro. The ill-fated expedition ran into trouble as soon as the mercenary regiments had landed on the shores of Lustria. The sailors of the ships, who were also mercenaries, weighed anchor and abandoned the soldiers, taking the pay chests of the three regiments with them. Of course, as a precaution against an opposed landing, the pay chests had been left to last! \\n\\nPirazzo was the only commander to advise against leaving the pay chests behind and the mercenaries now realized that he was by far the best leader and the other regiments mutinied. Their incompetent and unfortunate captains were cast adrift and the remaining men joined together as a single regiment under Pirazzo’s command, calling themselves the ‘Lost Legion’. \\n\\nThe Lost Legion, thirsty for the riches hidden in the jungle, embarked on a series of grand adventures and battles. First they clashed against the Skinks and Lizardmen, until a pragmatic Slann Mage priest used both magic and payment in treasure to turn the Lost Legion's pikes and crossbows towards the undead of the Vampire Coast. Victorious, Pirazzo's mercenaries assembled a fleet and crossed the ocean. They landed in Araby and then fought their way through Sartosa to finally arrive in Tilea.",

This is the work of the Waywatchers, the deadly sentinels of the forest realms.",
	"description_ww_hood_0003": "A battle hood from the Hall of Tal Amere in Atylwyth, the winter realm of Athel Loren. It's delicate fabric is  able to keep the wearer warm far beyond expectation, a useful property for Kerillian as she walks the often cold and hostile land of men.",
	"description_ww_hood_0004": "As the persecutors of trespassers and invaders, many Waywatchers pay homage to Drakira, Queen of Vengeance. Like the Waywatchers, Drakira is easily bored by the conventions of society and a willing outcast from her own kind.\\n\\nShe loves nothing more than to see the transgressions of the past repaid in blood and fire. Kerillian holds Drakira highly, but prays first and foremost to Lileath, the Elven Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Fortune.",
	"description_ww_hood_0005": "The history of Athel Loren is divided into a series of 'Great Seasons', each marking the passing of several centuries. There seems to be no set triggers that determines the length of a Great Season, and just like in the history of other species, the shift into a new era often goes unnoticed until many years after the fact. \\n\\nA new Season has recently begun for the Wood Elves, the Season of Doom, and Kerillian is gradually becoming aware of its ramifications.",
	"description_ww_hood_0007": "The Worldroots are the magical pathways the Wood Elves use for long distance travelling, and how Kerillian first appeared in the Empire. Why she left Athel Loren is still shrouded in mystery.\\n\\n'Free to leave, but nowhere to go.' - Kerillian",
	"description_ww_hood_0008": "The Wild Heath is the Western borderland of Athel Loren, a vast tract of open heath and brush. Kerillian has made many forays into this landscape of scattered groves and heather, stalking both two and four-legged prey.\\n\\n'They're only rats. Treat them as such.' - Kerillian",
	"description_ww_hood_0009": "A simple and plain hood that's been with Kerillian since her earliest days as a Waywatcher. A reminder of both home and family and the obstacles that have to be overcome if she's to ever see Athel Loren again.",
	"description_ww_hood_0010": "The realms of men will always be alien to Kerillian, and not a single day goes by without her thinking of her home with a longing and saddened heart.",
	"description_ww_hood_0011": "Ereth Khial, the Pale Queen, is the supreme Goddess of the elven underworld. Up until the Coming of Chaos, it was she who harvested the souls of all dead elves.\\n\\nAll changed with the rise of Slaanesh, the Dark Prince, who covets Elven souls above all others, and for millennia, it is he who has been feeding on the essence of the elven dead.\\n\\nThe elves employ various methods to avoid being devoured by the Chaos god upon death, and one option is to pay homage to the Pale Queen. She has far from given up the fight, and sometimes manages to steal away souls from the insatiable Slaanesh. Showing proper respect to Pale Queen might call her into action, and thus save your soul from the clutches of chaos.",
	"description_ww_hood_0012": "Winter never comes to the verdant reaches of Arranoc, the Summerstrand. Here, the glades are ever dappled by brilliant sunshine all year round. Likewise, night seldom falls in this part of the forest and, even when it does, the hours of darkness are few and fleeting. \\n\\nThe Elves of this realm are generous, and given to holding lavish feasts at the slightest provocation. They are also, unlike many of Athel Loren’s denizens, welcoming to peaceable outsiders, and waste no time including interlopers in the festivities. Many such ‘guests’ are resistant at first, but the first mouthful of sprigwine swiftly overcomes most resistance.\\n\\nSo it is that many outsiders have bided for long centuries in the glades of the Summerstrand, eating, drinking, making merry and seldom marking the passage of time. Few notice that their Elven feast-partners change as the hours and days pass, or that their hosts are more measured in the sampling of delights. \\n\\nEven fewer notice when their fellow guests, insensate with indolence, are carried from the feast by silent Dryad attendants. These glutted creatures are left at the entrance to the Vaults of Winter. Those ancient caverns are the work of a civilisation older than the Elves, and are home to beings that feast on reeking and pleasure-sodden souls. \\n\\nThus do the guests of Arranoc pass from this world, sacrificed to sate creatures that would otherwise prey on the Elves of the Summerstrand.",
	"description_ww_hood_0013": "The Wild Riders of Kurnous are Orion’s personal guard, each as aggressive and impulsive as he. They are fey and dangerous creatures who are no longer truly the Elves they once were. Now and forever they are a part of the Wild Hunt’s eternal glory.\\n\\nIn appearance, Wild Riders are throwbacks to the ancient days of the Elves. Their weapons are things of crude iron, or even flint; their ceremonial robes and armour seldom more than the pelts of animals slain during their sacred hunts. \\n\\nYet there is an otherworldliness and nobility about the Wild Riders that cannot easily be denied; the power of Kurnous flows through them as surely as it does through Orion.",
	"description_ww_hood_0014": "Orion is the king of Athel Loren. He is immortal, but his existence is irrevocably tied to the seasons. Thus does he pass willingly into his own funeral pyre each midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life on the first day of spring. \\n\\nEach year, on the eve of the vernal equinox, the Wild Riders select a young prince who will bear the mantle of Orion for the coming year. This chosen one is led to the Oak of Ages and given over to Ariel’s keeping. \\n\\nThere, she works the miracle of rebirth, sculpting her lost husband anew from the chosen one’s flesh and Kurnous’ spirit. On the following morning, the chosen one emerges from the Oak’s embrace, a mortal Elf no longer, but reborn as Orion, god-king of Athel Loren. \\n\\nOrion is at the height of his powers at Midsummer and wearing this headgear during that time is said to channel a sliver of his royal strength to the owner.",
