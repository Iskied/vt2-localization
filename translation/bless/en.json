We've investigating to do and raki to slaughter.","pdr_de_loading_screen_catacombs_02":"It just gets worse, dawri. Now there's talk of madness and bloodletting in the Shallya Hospice. Just like the raki not to seek a fair fight. Well, a fair fight's found them nonetheless, hasn't it? Well, maybe not a fair one...","pdr_de_loading_screen_cemetary_01":"Lots of poison seeping into Helmgart, and Lohner reckons it's coming from Morr's Field. Typical raki! No respect for the dead. We'd better get to the bottom of it, eh dawri? I'm heard there's good stonework in Morr's Field. It'd be nice to take a look.","pdr_de_loading_screen_cemetary_02":"The raki are brewing poison in the Garden of Morr, of all places. I don't know ... just doesn't seem respectful, does it?

Sounds fun!","pdr_de_loading_screen_crawl_01":"Funny thing, but the Pactsworn aren't making trouble just now. Well, this dawi's never been one to pass good fortune by.

Who's in?","pdr_de_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01":"Never thought I'd find myself seeking out one of Alaric the Mad's Chaos runeswords, but here we are.

Then we can forget we ever saw the kruting thing.","pdr_de_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02":"It's a black day, dawri. Seems the trouble in Bögenhafen's all come about because of a Chaos runesword, forged by Alaric the Mad - as rotten a dawi as you could ever hope to never find. One Father Kraussman has put it under lock and key. We just have to find him.","pdr_de_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01":"Seems we're off to Bögenhafen, dawri. There's talk of plague, and a real nasty one too. Of course, it could be coincidence, but this smells like raki business to me. Lohner agrees, which is why he's agreed to let us take a look.","pdr_de_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02":"Bögenhafen, eh? Not the Empire's finest town, but it's not like we get to see many nice places, is it dawri? Lohner's wittering about a plague, and you know what follows plague around here, don't you? Let's take a look.","pdr_de_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01":"Aldrinn's having trouble with her magical bridge. I warned her, of course - never trust magic! - but she didn't listen. Anyway, she reckons the Temple of Yenlui's something to do with the problem, so guess where we're headed?","pdr_de_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02":"Aldrinn's complaining that her magical bridge isn't working as it should. No matter to me - I don't mind walking places - but Lohner wants us to check out the Temple of Yenlui and see if we can put a stop to the interference. Might've known there'd be elves involved.","pdr_de_loading_screen_farmland_01":"The kazaki'dum are running wild in the farmlands around Ussingen. Slaughter. Pillage. General, all-round gobbo behaviour that's unseemly in anything over three feet tall. But we'll put 'em right, you'll see. Not that any'll survive the lesson, of course.","pdr_de_loading_screen_farmland_02":"The cowardly Pactsworn have given up on fighting them who can fight back, and are terrorising the farms around Ussingen. Don't know about you, dawri, but I don't take kindly to that kind of behaviour. We'll save who we can, and avenge the rest.","pdr_de_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01":"That clamour you hear at night's a whole bunch of raki labouring away at making some of those 'doomwheels' of theirs. I've faced those kruting things before, and it's a sight easier to stop 'em before them start - so let's get to it!","pdr_de_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02":"Raki love building war engines. Ricketty, ugly, umgak war engines, but quantity sometimes counts more than quality. I hear tell there's a load of them in the forest nearby, and it's up to us to smash them to bits.","pdr_de_loading_screen_fort_01":"Fort Brachsenbrücke's under assault. It won't last the night unless they get some assistance, double-quick. That's where we come in, dawri. Bit of axe work and a generous touch of heroics, and we'll get this matter good and sorted.","pdr_de_loading_screen_fort_02":"We're off to Fort Brachsenbrücke. Apparently, it's under siege by the Pactsworn, and Lohner wants us to help out. Grimgi isn't convinced four of us can make a difference. He's wrong, of course. I'm worth a good dozen all by myself, and that's sober!","pdr_de_loading_screen_ground_zero_01":"Lohner's muttering bleakly about a poisonous mist down in the bowels of Helmgart, and a kazaki'dum sorcerer at the heart of it all. Pick yourselves up, dawri - there's killing to do. It'll be fun!","pdr_de_loading_screen_ground_zero_02":"Seems there's a zilazdumi causing trouble in Helmgart. Lohner's talking about toxic mist, which I'll allow doesn't sound good. We'd better go chastise that arrogant little kruti before he makes things even worse around here.","pdr_de_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01":"Seems the Aldrinn's gone looking for this Skittergate the Pactsworn are using to attack Helmgart. We can't have the old biddy getting caught, so we'll be ringing the bells in the Temple of Sigmar to get the raki and the kazaki'dum looking in the wrong direction.","pdr_de_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02":"So Lohner wants a distraction, eh? Not a problem - I was put on this world to be distracting! We'll head to the Temple of Sigmar and get the bells ringing. That, along with wreaking a bit of carnage along the way, should do the trick.","pdr_de_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01":"Raki? In Ubersreik? And just when I was getting bored. Time to be heroes, dawri - we need to warn the populace they're about to be up to their ears in vermin. Best way to do that's to blow the horn at Magnus Tower ... if we can find it.","pdr_de_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02":"Ubersreik's under attack! Someone has to raise the alarm, dawri, and it looks like that someone is us! I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, but you stay close to your Uncle Bardin and keep your wits, and you'll do just fine.","pdr_de_loading_screen_mines_01":"Must be my lucky day, dawri! There's trolls in them there mines, and we're going to deal with the matter. Bring a couple of sacks, would you? Be a crying shame to let so much troll meat go to waste! I'll whip us up some kulgur once the job's done!","pdr_de_loading_screen_mines_02":"The kazaki'dum are breeding trolls! Trolls, of all things. And I'll wager it's not because they want scented candles, delicious cheese or a source of meat for a memorable stew. There's nothing for it: we'll have to shut it down. Dibs on the troll meat!","pdr_de_loading_screen_nurgle_01":"Ancient monolith? Rotbloods? Raki? Talk of some ghastly fate if some bold - and well-bearded - heroes don't put the matter to rest? Sign me up, dawri! Sounds like a good time for all concerned! Well ... us, anyway.","pdr_de_loading_screen_nurgle_02":"Seems the Rotbloods are digging some sorcerous muck out of the swamp muck. Can't see what they want with the thing, but if they want it, we don't want them to have it, do we dawri? Let's break a few heads and get it reburied.","pdr_de_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01":"Karak Gnol fell years ago, but we've a chance to set matters right. Lohner's got a line on a raki warlord ripe for a bit of grudge-thumping, and it'll even set the skaven back a square or two on the gameboard. Time for glory, dawri!","pdr_de_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02":"There's a raki warlord squatting down in Karak Gnol. It's up to us to give the wazzok a good kicking, and settle a few grudges on behalf of the hold's previous owners, if you follow, drengbarazi? Could get messy, which is just how I like it.","pdr_de_loading_screen_skittergate_01":"Lohner says the Skittergate's unguarded - or nearly enough. That means it's time for us to go smash the kruting thing, once and for all, dawri. It'll mean a trip through to the other side, but we're in this life for adventure, aren't we?","pdr_de_loading_screen_skittergate_02":"That Skittergate's giving the Pactsworn an endless supply of reinforcements, so it's going to have to come down. I hear we'll have to travel to the other end to get the job done, so dress up warm. It's not called the Frozen North for nothing.","pdr_de_loading_screen_ussingen_01":"The Rotbloods have taken over Ussingen - those bits they didn't raze to the ground, anyway. Turns out they're using the town as a waystation, and have the Baron's manor stuffed full of supplies. Be a proper shame if something happened to it, eh?","pdr_de_loading_screen_ussingen_02":"There's trouble down at Ussingen, true enough. Pactsworn have turned the Barons' manor into a kruting huge grain silo and it's up to us to blow the thing to pieces. Just the kind of work we live for, eh dawri?","pdr_de_portals_briefing_01":"The Pactsworn are up to their old tricks, snatching folk from their beds - this time in the shadow of Castle Drachenfels, no less. I'm not in any hurry to go back up there, but we're heroes, dawri. That's what we do. We put things right.","pdr_de_portals_briefing_02":"The Pactsworn are making trouble up at Castle Drachenfels, raiding the nearby villages for some ghastly purpose of theirs. Sounds like they need someone to put 'em right, and no skimping on the axe-work. What do you reckon, drengbarazi?","pdr_wp_bless_conversation_eleven_01":"Funny how umgi gods need to make themselves known through acts of magic. Wisdom serves better, if you ask me.","pdr_wp_bless_conversation_eleven_02":"You say that ... but if it looks like a rock-trout, tastes like a rock-trout and is as slippery as a rock-trout, it's likely a rock-trout.","pdr_wp_bless_conversation_eleven_03":"Aye. Valaya loved a fish supper. You'd be surprised how many of her parables have scales.","pdr_wp_bless_conversation_thirteen_02":"Aye. Nice lad, Sigmar - or so our stories tell, but lacking a certain ... physical gravitas. Still, history is written by the man who pays the skalds, eh?","pes_bless_conversation_eight_01":"Well,  Saltzpyre's faith burns stronger than ever.","pes_bless_conversation_eighteen_01":"From my worldly sins? I'm not sure we've got time for that, to be honest.","pes_bless_conversation_eighteen_02":"Oh yeah? Very generous. Thanks.","pes_bless_conversation_five_01":"Yeah. Sigmar can work miracles, but he's got his limits.","pes_bless_conversation_nine_01":"Don't be so hasty, Sienna. What's more important - Saltzpyre's unhappiness, or saving the Empire?","pes_bless_conversation_nineteen_01":"No no no no. No, I'm quite happy with a pantheon at my back, thank you very much. Strength in numbers has always served the Empire well.","pes_bless_conversation_nineteen_02":"Good to know. But don't hold your breath.","pes_bless_conversation_seven_01":"I dunno. Doesn't really seem that different to me.","pes_bless_conversation_seventeen_01":"Sigmar's voice, then? I always imagined him to be a big, booming presence. Like thunder.","pes_bless_conversation_seventeen_02":"You sure about that? I mean, Bardin snores something fierce. Could be you've mistaken one for the other.","pes_bless_conversation_seventeen_03":"Guess we'll find out, one way or another.","pes_bless_conversation_six_01":"Long may it last, says I. We'll make a human being of him yet.","pes_bless_conversation_sixteen_01":"So, what's it like? Having actually heard Sigmar's voice?","pes_bless_conversation_sixteen_02":"You'll forgive me for saying so, but 'humble' ain't exactly a word I'd peg you with.","pes_bless_conversation_twenty_01":"So ... Oh Herald of Sigmar ... Any chance of the big guy actually helping us out?","pes_bless_conversation_twenty_02":"That wasn't exactly a 'yes', now was it?","pes_gk_bastion_briefing_01":"We're no closer to puzzling out what the Pactsworn are after, but at least we're inside the castle. Hark at me, talking like that's a good thing. There are answers here - I can smell 'em. But that doesn't mean any of us are going to like 'em. Our luck just doesn't break that way.","pes_gk_bastion_briefing_02":"We'll, we're inside Castle Drachenfels, which you might think is a good thing - but it's Castle Drachenfels. Ain't much good about that, whichever way you look at it. The only silver lining is that it gets us closer to whatever maniac's running loose in here. Actually, now I think about it that doesn't sound very good, neither.","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentyeight_01":"Gotta wonder, haven't you, why the Empire and Bretonnia don't get along better?","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentyeight_02":"Yeah, or the Empire raising up one of their own and calling him a god so's they can prove their superiority.","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentyeight_03":"Can't argue with that.","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentynine_01":"Yeah. Here's to the bloody Ubersreik Five, standing as one ...","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentynine_02":"Yeah, I guess. Can't hurt, can it Bardin?","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentysix_01":"Oh you do, do you, peasant?","pes_gk_bless_conversation_twentysix_02":"Reckon I would, so I'll stick with the Lady of the Lake, if it's all the same to you.","pes_gk_castle_briefing_01":"We've hit a break, of sorts. Constant Drachenfels - assuming he even exists - ain't the author of these particular woes. Which gives a me a warm fuzzy feeling, let me tell you. Doesn't mean there isn't a Rotblood who needs a good kicking, mind. And who better to oblige than the Ubersreik bloody Five?","pes_gk_castle_briefing_02":"Old Drachenfels ain't home, or at least he's being quiet about it. Suits me. Leaves us free to lay a clobbering on the rest of the Rotbloods, and the sorcerer who's been laying out so much death and horror on the Grey Mountains. This is gonna be a righteous one. I can feel it in my bones.","pes_gk_crater_loading_screen_01":"We've had a meteor strike somewhere to the south of here. Business for an Astromancer, you might say, but we've not had a member of the Celestial College hereabouts since Olesya stabbed the last one in the leg. Made for a bit of an atmosphere, you might say. So now it's just another job for the Ubersreik Five.","pes_gk_crater_loading_screen_02":"Meteors ain't exactly known for being omens of *good* fortune, now are they? But this one's looking to set a new, horrible record. Olesya's twitchy, Lohner looks worried… even Sienna's muttering darkly, so I guess we'd better go take a look at the impact site. Hopefully it's nothing.","pes_gk_loading_screen_bell_01":"What is it with ratmen and bells, anyway? They've only gone and raised one up in Helmgart, so guess what I'm doing tonight? That's right, finding a way to wreck the bloody thing before it goes and makes matters worse. I'll have help, of course. The Ubersreik Five rides again. Well, walks. Doesn't sounds as good though, does it?","pes_gk_loading_screen_bell_02":"I've had better days. Lohner's making jokes about pumpkins, and the skaven have rigged one of their cursed bells up in the centre of Helmgart. It'll have to go, and we're the fellows to get the job done, but my ears were ringing for weeks after the last one. At least I won't be able to hear Lohner's gourd-based obsessions for a while.","pes_gk_loading_screen_catacombs_01":"There's trouble brewing in the Shallyan Hospice, and I'm not talking about that vile swamp-nettle beer the Sister Superior insists is a marvellous curative. Has the smell of Chaos magic about it, according to Olesya, and she's not talking about the swamp-nettle beer either.","pes_gk_loading_screen_catacombs_02":"Well, Helmgart's seen better days, but at least the Shallyan Hospice was a safe haven for the sick. At least, it was. Now there are folk disappearing right out of their beds, and that's just impolite. Lohner, being a man of good sense, reckons we should take a little walk and see if we can find someone to discourage. Seems like a plan.","pes_gk_loading_screen_cemetary_01":"There's something funny in the water, and it's not the usual dead dogs and drunks. The ratmen are up to their little tricks out in Morr's Field, and if we don't put a stop to it before the ale runs out it's gonna be trouble for everyone.","pes_gk_loading_screen_cemetary_02":"Ratmen do love their poisons, and right now Ubersreik's got enough troubles without wondering why the water's a strange shade of bowel-loosening green. According to Lohner, the problem starts out in Morr's Field. That sounds about right, but blow me if I can work out why...","pes_gk_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01":"Apparently, we've drawn a bit too much attention. There's a Rotblood champion camped out in the marshes set on finding the keep and burying us all beneath it. Can't say I'm fond of that idea, myself. Nor are the the others, so this Bödvarr Ribspreader's about to have a very bad day. Maybe even the worst, if Bardin starts singing at him.","pes_gk_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02":"Bödvarr Ribspreader. Sounds like a nice lad, if a bit lacking in the social graces. Then again, what do you expect of a Rotblood champion? He and his mates are camped out in the marshes - more bloody marshes, I ask you - and we're to pay him a bit of a visit and ask him to pack in his nonsense. Well, I say 'ask', but as we've established, social graces don't go far with his sort.","pes_gk_loading_screen_crawl_01":"We've hit a lull, and Lohner's kicked us all out of the keep so we can grab a quiet drink. A quiet drink? One sniff of a good brandy and Saltzpyre starts chuffing and whistling. Still, I suppose Helmgart's had worse lately, and I do have a powerful thirst...","pes_gk_loading_screen_crawl_02":"It's gone quiet. We're all surprised. Saltzpyre almost smiled, and if that ain't a sign of strange times, I don't know what is. Lohner's suggested we wander into what's left of Helmgart and have a quiet drink. Well, don't let it be said that Mother Kruber's favourite son never answered the call.","pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01":"Lohner was right about Bögenhafen. There's a Chaos runesword at the root of it, and a real nasty one too. Lucky for us, Father Kraussman has it sealed away, and all we've got to do is get it off him. Turns out Kraussman's an old friend of Saltzpyre's - one he hasn't seen in years - so I'm sure that'll work out just fine.","pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02":"Seems our Bögenhafen problem centers on a corrupted runesword, forged by a mad dwarf… well, a slightly madder-than-normal dwarf, leastways. The Blightreaper, it's called, and one Father Kraussman has it locked away just waiting for us to take it off his hands. Yeah, right. When is it ever that easy for the Ubersreik Five?","pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01":"Join the army, see the world. They never said anything about seeing the nice parts, did they? Bloody fine print. Take Bögenhafen. It's more swamp than city, which is probably why it's crawling with plague. Not that Lohner listens to me, of course. As usual, he blames the Rotbloods. Worst of it is, he's probably right. I hate it when he's right.","pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02":"Bögenhafen. That takes me back - but don't ask me why, or I'll have to kill you and that'd make me sad. There's plague in the town right now, but Lohner thinks there's more to it than that. And when Lohner gets an itchy feeling, I get to sharpening my weapons. Not sure what we're getting into with this one, but there's bound to be a fight.","pes_gk_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01":"For the last couple of days, Olesya's been moaning that the Bridge of Shadows ain't working right. Luckily for the rest of us - she does have a good pair of lungs on her - she's narrowed down the source of the disruption to an old elven temple. Probably dangerous. Might get killed. But that's better than sticking around here when Olesya's in a mood.","pes_gk_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02":"Olesya's getting interference in the Winds of Magic - whatever that means - and says it's centred on the temple of Athel Yenlui - whatever that is. It's bound to be the Rotbloods. Leastways, I hope so. If it's a mob of elven mages all off their heads on mushroom wine, then I'll leave Kerillian too it. One angry elf per Kruber, that's the strict limit.","pes_gk_loading_screen_farmland_01":"Plenty of good farmland around here. Problem is, the Rotbloods know it too. They're got raiding parties out, snatching whatever grain they can lay their filthy hands on, and plenty of farmers too. Can't be Chaos-worshipping scum without a good ritual, can you? Well, we're gonna get the poor buggers back, whatever takes.","pes_gk_loading_screen_farmland_02":"We've got Rotbloods pillaging the farms around Ussingen. Worse than that, the useless bloody civvies refused to scarper at the first smoke column over their fields and got nabbed. Wouldn't want their life expectancy right now, even with the bloody Ubersreik Five coming to the rescue. Which of course we bloody are. That's the bloody job.","pes_gk_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01":"Seems the skaven are busy building war machines out in the forest, and it's up to us to smash 'em to pieces. I'm not saying I don't like the idea, but it does all seem a bit familiar. I've got to stop eating that cheese before bed. Anything Bardin keeps beneath the helmet of his can't be good for you.","pes_gk_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02":"Wandering around the forest, looking for skaven war machines? You ever get that feeling there's an echo in your life? Worse part is, every time I think I know what's going on, the feeling slips away. Best to take in out on the ratmen. The vicious little buggers have it coming.","pes_gk_loading_screen_fort_01":"Saltzpyre doesn't trust Olesya's portals, but I bloody love 'em. It'd take days to get up to Fort Brachsenbrücke by cart, and the bloody fortress will have fallen by then. This way we should get there before that happens - assuming we can find this back way in that Lohner's so keen on. After that, we'll see. I do hope it involves killing. I'm good at that.","pes_gk_loading_screen_fort_02":"Fort Brachsenbrücke's in trouble. Of course, it's always in trouble, what with its castellan being drunk half the time, and asleep the other half. But now they've got a Pactsworn problem as well. If the fortress folds, that'll be it for half of the Reikland, and would you believe it's the half I actually like? Can't have that.","pes_gk_loading_screen_ground_zero_01":"If things weren't already bad enough in Helmgart, there's a sorcerer conjuring - and I quote - a mist so poisonous it'll make your blood rot in your veins. So naturally, Lohner's sending us right into the thick of it. He's a good sort, but would it kill him to get out in the field once in a while? Right. Better get this done. Have to set an example for the others, don't I?","pes_gk_loading_screen_ground_zero_02":"There's a sorcerer causing trouble down in Helmgart. Can't remember his name - I'm pretty sure Lohner makes these things up, anyway. Whatever the bugger calls himself, apparently he's whipping up a toxic mist to drown the whole city. Which means me and mine get to play 'hide the pointy implement' with his rotten hide until he takes 'no' for an answer.","pes_gk_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01":"Apparently, Olesya's sneaking around looking for the Skittergate - which suits me fine, 'cos it means she's not looking for *me*. Only, she needs a distraction to get the job done. I told Lohner the Old Biddy's quite distracting enough, but I don't think he heard me, so the rest of us are off to ring the bells in the Temple of Sigmar.","pes_gk_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02":"Lohner wants a distraction, and apparently getting Saltzpyre drunk on brandy and setting him loose in the marketplace just ain't gonna cut it. So we're heading up to the Temple of Sigmar to set the bells ringing. Course, there's every chance the skaven have got there first, so I'm still hoping someone wants to go with the brandy plan. I'll talk to Kerillian. She might be up for it.","pes_gk_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01":"Some homecoming this is: stuck in Ubersreik just as the skaven decide it's the perfect holiday spot. But the city won't fall without a fight… at least, if there's a warning. So it's off to Magnus Tower with this peculiar lot to raise the alarm. They're an odd bunch, but I get the feeling it's all gonna work out...","pes_gk_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02":"Looks like we're off to Magnus Tower to sound the alarm and warn Ubersreik that the skaven ain't gonna take 'no' for an answer. Ain't gonna lie, this don't look good… but that's not even the worst part. I've got a funny feeling that I've done all this before. It's weird. I either need to stop drinking, or drink more.","pes_gk_loading_screen_mines_01":"Turns out the Rotbloods' bile trolls ain't nothing natural, but some kind of sorcerous perversion. I think it was the word 'perversion' that got Saltzpyre interested, because now we're off to the Dreisdunkel Mines to see if we can put an end to the business. Bloody hate trolls. They smell worse than Bardin, and die twice as hard.","pes_gk_loading_screen_mines_02":"Trolls? Who breeds Trolls? I mean, there was this one village out in Ostland where everyone looked a bit warty, but that was the plague. I think. Never did find out who burned it down. That aside, seems the Rotbloods are taking a bunch of your common or garden trolls and twisting 'em something rotten. That ain't good for the Reikland, so we're off to Dreisdunkel Mine to put a stop to it.","pes_gk_loading_screen_nurgle_01":"Olesya reckons the Rotbloods are digging some kind of ancient monolith out of the swamp. Leave 'em to it, says I, but Lohner and Saltzpyre do so enjoy making things difficult for the rest of us, so we're off to get the bloody thing reburied. It's mud, death and rats for lucky old Kruber - and wet feet too, I shouldn't wonder. Still, can't complain.","pes_gk_loading_screen_nurgle_02":"Kruber's Rule Number One for a Happy Life: don't go messing with ghastly ancient monoliths. Seems the Rotbloods haven't got the message, as they're digging one out of the swamp as we speak. Guess who's drawn the task of getting the bloody thing reburied? I get all the nice jobs. Still, at least it'll get me away from Olesya... that woman keeps giving me funny looks.","pes_gk_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01":"Off we go again. This time, down into the caves of Karak Gnol to giving a ratman warlord a fatal kicking. Who says nice things don't happen to nice people? Hasn't been a dwarf down there for ages, worse luck, and the halls are infested with skaven. Still, it'll be nice to be going after the boss for a change. Officers are all the same pointy ears and twitching tails or no...","pes_gk_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02":"It's a good life, if you don't weaken. Today, it seems, I'm an assassin. Won't be the first time, and probably not the last. The target? The skaven warlord camped down in Karak Gnol. We're to sneak in, give him a Tilean handshake, and sneak back out again. Lohner's promised payments in pumpkins again. That man's got a thing about pumpkins. It ain't healthy.","pes_gk_loading_screen_skittergate_01":"Lohner reckons the Skittergate's as unguarded as it's gonna get, so guess where poor bloody Kruber and his merry maniacs are off to next? Gotta be honest, I ain't looking forward to this one. Ain't enough to wreck it from this end, you see. We've got to ride the bloody contraption to the frozen bloody north and put the boot in from there. I need a drink...","pes_gk_loading_screen_skittergate_02":"Right. This could be a ticklish one. No two ways about it - that Skittergate's got to go down, and there's no one else to do the job. Problem is, we can't do it from the Helmgate side. We'll have to travel to the frozen north and give it a thumping from that end, too. Lohner reckons it'll work, but you'll notice that he's staying home for this one...","pes_gk_loading_screen_ussingen_01":"Rotbloods have sacked Ussingen and turned the Baron's manor into a storehouse. Now, you know how an army marches on its stomach - those that don't march on rotgut brandy and soured ale, leastways - well, it's true of the northlanders as well. So we're gonna blow up the manor, supplies and all. Fun times.","pes_gk_loading_screen_ussingen_02":"Looks like Ussingen's had it. The town's proper ruined, but we've still got a chance to even the score. Them Rotbloods have been filling the Baron's manor with all the grain they can steal - which is a lot - so we're gonna blow the bloody thing to pieces. Won't bring back the dead, but no good ever comes from doing that anyhow, does it?","pes_gk_portals_briefing_01":"Lohner's breaking out the pumpkin jokes again, so you know it's bad. The Pactsworn are kidnapping folk in the shadow of Castle Drachenfels, and it's down to us to put things right. Can't say I'm keen risking my neck up there again - bloody lucky to get out last time, if you ask me - but that's the soldier's life, ain't it?","pes_gk_portals_briefing_02":"The Pactsworn are camped out in Castle Drachenfels and making trouble in the villages below. Bad news for everyone, especially if one or two of the nastier myths are true. So my thinking is we'd better make this fast. Lucky for us, we've got killing Rotbloods and ratmen down to a fine art. But you know what they say about practice making perfect.","pwe_bless_conversation_eight_01":"I know. I curse the day we set foot in the Citadel of Eternity.","pwe_bless_conversation_five_01":"As it should be. A genuine smile from One-Eye? It is surely a sign that the End Times are upon us.","pwe_bless_conversation_four_01":"That by you is might? We have gods who can crack the world apart, drown cities with the seas or exhort whole populations to exquisite savagery. I think your little storm god might be a wee bit outnumbered.","pwe_bless_conversation_four_02":"Some will make a stand, have no doubt. Alas, the others are likely waiting to see which side to take.","pwe_bless_conversation_nine_01":"I think we all know the answer to that one.","pwe_bless_conversation_one_01":"Oh, One-Eye. Such poetry. Next you'll be telling me you've learned the value of mercy.","pwe_bless_conversation_one_02":"Glad to hear it. I'd hate to think you've gone soft.","pwe_bless_conversation_seven_01":"That's because he likes you, Kruber. He's back to looking strangely at Sienna and I.","pwe_bless_conversation_six_01":"He always had a purpose, Bardin. That was the problem.","pwe_bless_conversation_three_01":"That magic you manifest, Saltzpyre ... It looks like it tingles. Does it tingle?","pwe_bless_conversation_three_02":"Aye, very impressive. But you didn't answer the question.","pwe_bless_conversation_two_01":"I confess, One-Eye, I never really believed Sigmar was a god, but you're making me reconsider.","pwe_bless_conversation_two_02":"Don't push it. ","pwe_st_bastion_briefing_01":"This is no simple kidnapping. Foul sorcery hangs about Castle Drachenfels like a mantle, and I dread to think what occurs within the walls. Rescue is needed for those the Pactsworn have taken, but I feel a strange foreboding ...","pwe_st_bastion_briefing_02":"It seems we are to return to Castle Drachenfels to help those who cannot help themselves. I suppose that makes us heroes. Or fools. It's so hard to tell the two apart when I look at the company I keep.","pwe_st_bless_conversation_seven_01":"Would you say you hear Sigmar's voice clearer these days, meat?","pwe_st_bless_conversation_seven_02":"You should be carefully of godly intent, One-Eye. I know better than any how it can run strange roads.","pwe_st_bless_conversation_seven_03":"Believe as you wish. The truth will make itself known.","pwe_st_bless_conversation_six_01":"You? Who went running into the past to re-embrace one who'd already led you astray? I moved forward.","pwe_st_bless_conversation_six_02":"Then say nothing, meat.","pwe_st_castle_briefing_01":"A Rotblood sorcerer has made Castle Drachenfels his squalid nest. I feel no desire to return, but I suppose he'll have to be chastened, if only to set an example to his grubby little peers. So, let's get it over with. Maybe then I can put the place behind me for good.","pwe_st_castle_briefing_02":"Castle Drachenfels has become a Rotblood lair, and I've a wee notion that we shouldn't let some fat, arrogant sorcerer have the run of the place. There are perils enough within those stones already, and we've trouble enough without encouraging more.","pwe_st_crater_loading_screen_01":"Mother Olesya won't stop wittering about that meteor. Premonitions of doom and destruction ... I'd put her straight, but I think she might be right. My dreams were troubled last night, and I've learned to trust their wisdom. So rock-hunting it is.","pwe_st_crater_loading_screen_02":"A meteor crashed last night. Lohner thinks it's trouble. I agree, for the Weave is restless ... and that means warpstone. Much as I'd rather stay far away, we'll have to take a look. It'll only be trouble if the ratmen get ahold of it.","pwe_st_loading_screen_bell_01":"There's a warpstone bell up on Helmgart's walls, and that's not good for anyone. It's even giving the mayflies sore ears, and I've a headache fit to crack stone. There's nothing else for it - we'll have to teach the ratmen the value of silence.","pwe_st_loading_screen_bell_02":"The ratmen have raised a bell on Helmgart's walls. Might be a Screaming Bell. It might not. Either way, I agree with Lohner - the scunnered thing will have to come down, if only so we can have a little bit of peace and quiet.","pwe_st_loading_screen_catacombs_01":"If ever there was a place that shouldn't stink of dark magic, it's a Shallyan hospice. What are the Pactsworn up to down there? I suppose there's nothing for it but to go and take a wee look, and remonstrate, where appropriate.","pwe_st_loading_screen_catacombs_02":"The Pactsworn are causing mischief in a mayfly hospice. Presumably because picking on those who can fight back is beyond their meagre reserves of courage. Isn't it a shame that we're onto them?","pwe_st_loading_screen_cemetary_01":"The Weave is shuddering - the ratmen are brewing vile poison in Morr's Field. It's only a matter of time before it spreads, so for once Lohner and I find ourselves in accord as to what must be done. The 'what' being put an end to the ratman mischief. Permanently.","pwe_st_loading_screen_cemetary_02":"The ratmen are brewing poison in the Garden of Morr. Likely they're using mayfly corpses to do it, which is thrify of the wee scunners if nothing else. But it remains an affront to the Weave, so they won't be making their concoctions for much longer.","pwe_st_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01":"The northlanders are very unhappy with our recent deeds. It's so nice when one's efforts are appreciated, don't you think? Their chief - with the ridiculous name of Bödvarr Ribspreader - is looking for our keep. He'll have to be dissuaded. Permanently.","pwe_st_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02":"Bödvarr Ribspreader. Bödvarr Ribspreader? For that name alone he deserves to die. And die he will. Not for his ridiculous name - more's the pity - but for trying to locate Taal's Horn Keep. We can't have that, so let the bloody remonstration begin.","pwe_st_loading_screen_crawl_01":"Lohner's insisting we all head into Helmgart for a wee drink. I've nothing against that, not as such, but why do I have to do it in the company of mayflies? Oh well, I suppose there's no avoiding it. At least I can show the other how an elf maid holds her drink. That'll put them in their place.","pwe_st_loading_screen_crawl_02":"Helmgart is quiet - at least for the moment. That much is fine. The problem is, Lohner's decided we need to have what he refers to as 'a bit of quality downtime' by which he means I should go drinking with the mayflies. Why, I ask you, would I want to do that?","pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01":"Lohner's had word from a Father Kraussman, insisting that the Bögenhafen plague is due to a Chaos runesword, which we will have to retrieve if the town's to be spared. Don't we just get all of the nice jobs? I mean, would anyone miss Bögenhafen?","pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02":"So it appears that the trouble in Bögenhafen's down to a Chaos runesword. We're to seize the scunnered thing and get it somewhere safe. All well and good - I suppose - but I've a foreboding that it'll mean trudging through a sewer. Again.","pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01":"Bögenhafen is in the grips of a plague, and Lohner's convinced it's the work of the Pactsworn. Maybe he's right, maybe he's not, but there's no way to know for certain until we have a wee look around the place. You never know ...","pwe_st_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02":"Apparently there's plague in Bögenhafen. Lohner, not realising that there's plague everywhere, wants us to investigate. I'll be honest, I don't want to... but what would happen to the mayflies if I stayed behind? Nothing good.","pwe_st_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01":"The bridge of shadows isn't working as it should, so Olesya wants us to head to Athel Yenlui and put an end to the interference. I ... don't know that I want to go. Too many memories waiting to be stirred up. Too many regrets.","pwe_st_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02":"Mother Olesya's bridge of shadows is experiencing problems. She's tracked the interference back to the ruined temple of Athel Yenlui, and we're to investigate. I wonder if it'll feel like being back home? As if I care.","pwe_st_loading_screen_farmland_01":"The Pactsworn can't handle a proper fight, so now they're going after terrified peasants. Worthless scunners! I suspect we'll get there too late to do much good, but we can at least register our disapproval in the severest of terms.","pwe_st_loading_screen_farmland_02":"The Pactsworn are terrorising the farms around Ussingen. As much as I've little sympathy for mayflies who can't be bothered to learn to wield a sword, I find it all strangely annoying. Still, I'll feel better when the blood starts flowing and the screaming begins.","pwe_st_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01":"The ratmen are up to something out in the forest, clamouring night and day to make their ramshackle war machines. Lohner says we should go out there and destroy them. Well, I say that surely beats staying here listening to Goreksson's singing. ","pwe_st_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02":"We've been told that the ratmen are building war engines out in the forest. Well, we can't have that, can we? Another mission for Kerillian the Extraordinarily Heroic and her mayfly companions. Assuming they don't get themselves killed.","pwe_st_loading_screen_fort_01":"What if a handful of mayflies have gotten themselves trapped in Fort Brachsenbrücke? It's hardly my concern. Or it shouldn't be. But if I don't agree to go, Lohner will try that 'reverse psychology' of his again, and the poor man looks so pathetic that I'll start laughing at him. Again.","pwe_st_loading_screen_fort_02":"A mayfly fort is under siege by the Pactsworn. I keep telling Lohner that we're not exactly short of mayflies, but he insists we help the defenders out of the mess they've landed themselves in. I suppose it's as good a place as any to make partial amends for Hoggar's Bridge.","pwe_st_loading_screen_ground_zero_01":"Lohner's spinning a tale of a Rotblood sorcerer making trouble in Helmgart's ruins. I have generously decided to go along and end the scunner's foul existence. Someone's got to show the mayflies how it's done.","pwe_st_loading_screen_ground_zero_02":"A Rotblood sorcerer is making trouble in Helmgart. I say the town's beyond saving anyway, but Lohner - foolish mayfly that he is - doesn't agree. I suppose I could sit this one out, but the others would only get themselves killed. ","pwe_st_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01":"Olesya has gone into Helmgart to spy on the ratmen, and we're to create a distraction to make her life easier. So off to the Temple of Sigmar we go to ring out the bells. What can possibly go wrong with that? How long have you got?","pwe_st_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02":"Lohner wants us to cause a distraction. I suggested stripping Saltzpyre naked and hanging him from the city walls, but apparently that was a bit…too much. Instead, we're going to ring the bells at the Temple of Sigmar. Oh well, maybe next time.","pwe_st_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01":"Why did I ever come to Ubersreik? There are rats everywhere, and now the city's under siege. Brilliant. Just brilliant! These mayflies have begged me to help them sound the alarm, and I've agreed. Twice the fool, I suppose. Still, at least it won't be boring.","pwe_st_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02":"Ubersreik's under attack - as if I care - but I suppose there's no harm killing a few marauding ratmen. These mayflies are sure to make a botch of it without me. We're off to the Horn of Magnus to sound the alarm, but I'm sure I'll be doing all the work.","pwe_st_loading_screen_mines_01":"Is there no end to the northlanders' vile deeds? Trolls are foul enough without anyone splicing them with sorcery or daemons or whatever madcap scheme they've settled upon. They all have to die. What a shame. What a terrible, terrible, terrible shame.","pwe_st_loading_screen_mines_02":"The northlanders are breeding trolls down in an abandoned mine. Full points for ingenuity, if not for taste. Still, we can't have the brutish things wandering around, can we? The hard part will be to stop Goreksson cooking the remains, mark my words.","pwe_st_loading_screen_nurgle_01":"We go to the nicest places. This time it's a swamp, where the Rotbloods are excavating a vile and ancient idol. I suppose we'd better do something about it, otherwise I'll never hear the end of it. At least it can't smell worse than the dwarf.","pwe_st_loading_screen_nurgle_02":"[Disgusted noise]. The Rotbloods are digging around in the swamp. Now, you'd think it's the best place for them - and you'd be right - but Lohner says they're looking to harness the power of an ancient monolith. Can't have that.","pwe_st_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01":"The dwarfs, alas, have allowed the hold of Karak Gnol to fall into skaven hands. Careless. Very, very careless. So it's up to us to set matters right, and issue notice of eviction, inked in ratman blood. Another one Goreksson's going to owe me, but who's keeping count? Apart from me, obviously.","pwe_st_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02":"Dwarf holds attract all manner of vile, squalid creatures with aspirations of competence - starting, of course, with the dwarfs themselves. Karak Gnol, however, lies in the hands of a skaven warlord who needs to be quietly dislodged from this sphere of existence.","pwe_st_loading_screen_skittergate_01":"If Lohner's to be believed, the Skittergate's no longer guarded so closely as to make a direct assault a suicide mission, which I suppose is for the best. There'll be no peace until we destroy the foul contraption, and I so long for a bit of peace and quiet.","pwe_st_loading_screen_skittergate_02":"The ratmen are using one of their vile contraptions to keep reinforcements flooding in from the frozen north, and I for one am quite sick of it. So we're going to go up there  and ask them politely to desist. And then we're going to break their toy to little pieces.","pwe_st_loading_screen_ussingen_01":"The Rotbloods have seized Ussingen, and are even now using the Baron's manor as a storehouse for their plundered provisions. That's right - everything's in one place, just waiting to be burned, blown up or otherwise spoiled. This one ought to be fun.","pwe_st_loading_screen_ussingen_02":"It would appear that the northlanders, having a slender grip on practicalities such as 'logistics' and 'provisions' have filled the Baron's manor to the rafters with food supplies. Can't have that, can we? It'll all have to burn.","pwe_st_portals_briefing_01":"The Pactsworn - never ones to shy for cowardly deeds - are stealing folk from the villages around Castle Drachenfels. Will they never learn? Sienna's all for intervening, and so am I. For kidnappers should never prosper.","pwe_st_portals_briefing_02":"Castle Drachenfels. Lileath, but I'd hoped never to hear that name again, however the Pactsworn are making free with the local villagers, and I feel an overpowering urge to offer the chastisement of blade and bow. So, let the hunt begin.","pwh_bless_cinematic_line_four_04":"For Sigmar and the Empire!","pwh_bless_cinematic_line_three_01":"Have I ever let you down?","pwh_bless_cinematic_line_three_02":"Let us teach them fear.","pwh_bless_cinematic_line_three_03":"Victory favours the faithful.","pwh_bless_cinematic_line_two_04":"Where is your patience, Master Dwarf?","pwh_bless_cinematic_prayer_four_01":"By the Comet and the Hammer, I pledge to the coming battle. I vow not to waver, and never retreat. To stand tall against the flames of perdition. To drive back the shadow of Chaos with your holy light.","pwh_bless_cinematic_prayer_one_01":"Blessed Sigmar, the world drowns in corruption. Your Empire is aflame with heresy. The faithful perish. And the wicked multiply.","pwh_bless_cinematic_prayer_two_01":"Blessed Sigmar, lend me your strength. Grant me the will to purge the corrupt.  To smite the heretic. To bring hope when hope is lost.","pwh_bless_conversation_eleven_01":"As I have said before, I do not wield magic! It is faith made form!","pwh_bless_conversation_eleven_02":"This is the wisdom of your ancestor gods, I suppose?","pwh_bless_conversation_fourteen_02":"[Growl]","pwh_bless_conversation_thirteen_03":"[Growl]","pwh_hub_prayer_01":"All my life I have toiled in the darkness. The shadows claim me no more.","pwh_hub_prayer_02":"Blessed Sigmar, watch over these ingrates. Grant them fire to banish the darkness.","pwh_hub_prayer_03":"Sigmar, I stand before you as a supplicant. Grant me your strength. Your wrath.","pwh_hub_prayer_04":"Fill me with thy fire, O Sigmar! Bestow upon me the strength of ages and heavenly wrath!","pwh_hub_prayer_05":"By the Hammer and the Comet, I will see the Empire cleansed of invaders.","pwh_hub_prayer_06":"Let the blessings of thy heavenly might guide us in coming days, O Sigmar. Let thy strength be ours!","pwh_hub_prayer_07":"For the heretic, there is only death. For the unclean, there is only death. For the betrayer, there is only death. So shall it be.","pwh_hub_prayer_08":"I beseech thee, Heldenhammer ... do not abandon the Empire in this, its darkest hour. Send me a sign! A portent!","pwh_hub_prayer_09":"O blessed Sigmar, the day turns dark. I will fight to the bitter end, should that be your will, but must I do so without hope?","pwh_hub_prayer_10":"Who shall deliver us from darkness? Who shall smite the unbeliever? Who shall restore the fortunes of a broken Empire? Sigmar. Sigmar! SIGMAR!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_01":"By the Might of Sigmar!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_02":"The Hammer and the Anvil!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_03":"By the Twin-Tailed Comet!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_04":"By my faith!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_05":"Kneel before Sigmar!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_06":"Sigmar see my wrath!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_07":"The power of faith!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_08":"Faith unfurled!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_09":"Let triumph be ours!","pwh_wp_activate_ability_10":"By the hammer and the holy name!","pwh_wp_bastion_briefing_01":"Our path leads into the castle itself. I have no idea if those we seek are even alive, let alone ... unspoiled ... but a righteous man does not turn aside simply because the trail leads into darkness. I carry Sigmar's light, and I will triumph!","pwh_wp_bastion_briefing_02":"As we proceed deeper into Castle Drachenfels, my thoughts turn to the many legends about the place. Most are simple invention, I am sure, but others ... ? All the more reason to rescue the abductees with all haste. Fear is for the faithless.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_eighteen_01":"Kruber ... As I am now affirmed as a true herald of Sigmar Heldenhammer, I could grant you absolution.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_eighteen_02":"From your misguided worship of other gods.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_fifteen_01":"Tell me, Goreksson. Did any of your family ever fight alongside Sigmar?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_fifteen_02":"I think perhaps you've said enough, Master Dwarf.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_four_01":"See you now the true might of Sigmar, elf? What can your dreary pantheon hope to offer by comparison?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_four_02":"Perhaps. But where are your gods now Chaos overtakes the world? Hmmm?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_fourteen_01":"Goreksson, I must insist you do not spread your stories about ... Sigmar's beard.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_nineteen_01":"Kruber ... I still stand ready to offer Sigmar's forgiveness for your worship of Taal, Rhya, Ranald and that other--","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_nineteen_02":"As you wish. The offer will remain open ... indefinitely.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_one_01":"For years, you called me blind, elf. And perhaps I was. No more. Sigmar has shown me the error of my ways.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_one_02":"Alas, no. Mercy is weakness, and we can none of us afford to be anything other than strong.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_seven_01":"Not his voice, perhaps. But his intent chimes a clarion fit to split the skies.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_seven_02":"For pagan gods, perhaps. Not so for Sigmar.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_seventeen_01":"Oh, but it was more than that. A vibrancy fit to shake the very pillars of creation!","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_seventeen_02":"Do you really think I would mistake divine decree for the congestated nasal exhalations of a dwarf?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_six_01":"I ... believe I know a little of how you feel, elf.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_six_02":"There are times when I'm at a loss for what to say to you.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_sixteen_01":"Humbling, Kruber. I see now my place in his great plan as never before.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_sixteen_02":"I assure you, my soul has been laid bare. There can be no pretence otherwise.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_ten_01":"I'm afraid I don't follow, Master Dwarf.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_ten_02":"This is not magic. This is a holy manifestation of Sigmar's wrath.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_thirteen_01":"I should have embraced this change long ago, Goreksson. Perhaps my alliance with you was a sign.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_thirteen_02":"Thin-beard? Thin-beard?!","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_three_01":"You speak of holy fury for which I am but a conduit. ","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_three_02":"It ... has a certain pleasing warmth, I must confess. ","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twelve_01":"It is not magic!","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twelve_02":"The might of Sigmar requires no vessel save a faithful soul.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twenty_01":"The hour of his manifestation draws ever nigh.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twenty_02":"Faith, Kruber. You must have faith.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyeight_01":"I suspect it has much to do with the Sons of Gilles worshipping a heathen sorceress as a deity.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyeight_02":"I ... do not believe this conversation will prove fruitful.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfive_01":"There remains time to repent thy fallen ways, Fuegonasus. Embrace Sigmar, and he shall embrace you in turn.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfive_02":"You've been talking to Goreksson, haven't you?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfour_01":"We are allies, not friends. And we do not 'chat'. He makes his will known to me through less mundane means.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfour_02":"Signs. Portents. The flicker of a fire. The fall of a star. The murmuration of birds.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentynine_01":"In Sigmar's sight!","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyone_01":"Insufferable? I was never insufferable. Merely outspoken.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyone_02":"I ... defer to your judgement. After all, I am sure you have much to teach me on the topic of being insufferable.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyseven_01":"You mistake Sigmar as one whose day is done, Goreksson. I merely accept this his true hour is yet to come.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyseven_02":"I shall have no need. His return will be a clarion heard in all lands.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentysix_01":"I think the time has come to renounce your foreign sorceress and re-enter Sigmar's flock, Kruber.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentysix_02":"Indeed. Should the End Times be upon us, would you not rather be counted among those of true faith?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentysix_03":"Alas, Kruber. I had hoped you might see reason.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentythree_01":"You make it sound like he is close kin to the gods he worships!","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentythree_02":"Have a care not to draw me into your heresies.","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentythree_03":"Cease your treacherous words! We have labours to perform!","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentytwo_01":"Does my obvious contentment discomfort you so much?","pwh_wp_bless_conversation_two_01":"Most kind, I'm sure. Perhaps one day you will understand that all others are but empty reflections of his glory.","pwh_wp_casting_bark_01":"For Sigmar!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_03":"Comet's Fury!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_05":"Hammer's Wrath!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_07":"Faith in Fury!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_09":"Heldenhammer!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_11":"Hammer and Anvil!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_13":"Blessed Sigmar!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_15":"Sigmar's Wrath!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_17":"Purity!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_19":"Soul's Fury!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_21":"I am worthy!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_23":"Sigmar!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_25":"For thee, Sigmar!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_27":"Comet and Storm!","pwh_wp_casting_bark_29":"Hammer and Flame!","pwh_wp_castle_briefing_01":"Aha. It is not the spectre of Constant Drachenfels who haunts this castle, but a Rotblood who seeks to usurp legends for his own purposes. I find myself greatly cheered by the prospect. After all, what is a Witch Hunter without witches to hunt?","pwh_wp_castle_briefing_02":"A Rotblood has claimed Castle Drachenfels for his own, and I fear there is nothing else for it but to carve him to pieces in retribution for his black deeds. I jest, of course ... a grisly death was always to have been his fate. He has no one to blame for that but himself.","pwh_wp_crater_loading_screen_01":"Warpstone hath rained down upon the world. It must be recovered  - or destroyed - before the ratmen are able to retrieve it for themselves. This will be no easy mission, but I deem we are apt to the task. At least, if the others cooperate with my instructions ...","pwh_wp_crater_loading_screen_02":"A meteor split the skies this past night, and I fear it brings yet more warpstone into the world. Should the ratmen get their claws upon it, they will surely wreak great mischief before they're done. So we shall see that they do not, and enjoy ourselves greatly in the deed.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_bell_01":"The ratmen have raised a bell on Helmgart's wall. It is uncertain at this time if the artefact holds any great power, but Lohner and I are in agreement that we should not take the risk! We will have to bring it down. With all haste.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_bell_02":"If I am to understand Lohner correctly, either the ratmen have raised a bell on Helmgart's walls, or the town has been overrun by pumpkins! I confess I wasn't listening to the detail. I've found that it's often better not to. Still ... bell or pumpkins, I'm sure we will prevail.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_catacombs_01":"There is sorcery at work in the Shallyan Hospice, some malefic practice that I am sworn to root out and destroy. Ah, but it is almost like old times, when I had the support of my order ... and not a ragged band of misfits and ne'er do wells. Still, I shall persevere. Sigmar is testing me.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_catacombs_02":"The Shallyan Hospice has gone strangely silent, and rumours abound of vile magic at work beneath its hallowed walls. Such indignities shall not be borne. While the Shallyans are entirely too ... pacifist ... to be truly holy, they are nonetheless dedicated servants of righteousness. They shall be avenged!","pwh_wp_loading_screen_cemetary_01":"The ratmen are brewing their vile concoctions in Morr's Field. I shudder to think at the ingredients they employ in their labours, though in any case the response would be the same: immediate and thorough extermination! I shall treasure the coming moments. Simple pleasures should always be indulged.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_cemetary_02":"Poison abounds in the Garden of Morr - a place that should bask only in tranquility and mindfulness. Doubtless this is ratman work, and while we shall only know for certain once the investigation is underway, my nose is twitching.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01":"It seems we have drawn the notice of the northlander chief. Good. While an array of thankless victories against nameless opponents does honour to Sigmar, the ire of one's titled enemies ranks among the sweetest of achievements. Second only to their necessary and welcome demise.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02":"Our adversary in the northlander ranks has a name. Bödvarr Ribspreader. It is certainly ... colourful. But then, what does a name matter to a heretic bound for an unmarked grave in the Reikland mud? For that is where I intend to leave him.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_crawl_01":"Lohner is insisting that we take advantage of the recent lull and occupy ourselves with some 'quality bonding time'. The others, naturally, intend to drink  themselves into a stupor. But I intend to stay stone cold sober throughout. Someone must set an example.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_crawl_02":"Helmgart is ... quiet ... for the moment, and Lohner has suggested I spend the time carousing with my ... well, I suppose 'companions' is as good a word as any. Liquour is a mocker of wit, and the others have so few wits to begin with. I suppose I should accompany them. In a purely supervisory capacity.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01":"It appears that the Bögenhafen plague is the consequence of my old ... acquaintance ... Father Kraussman having uncovered a cursed Chaos rune sword. Will the man never learn? No matter. Wiser hands than his will bring the matter to an end. Namely, mine.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02":"The situation in Bögenhafen is worse than we believed. The plague is no natural event, but caused by the presence of a Chaos runesword. My old ... ally ... Father Kraussman has this Blightreaper under lock and key, but I would feel safer were it in more capable hands.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01":"There is plague in Bögenhafen. Of course, there often is - most likely due to the inbred inhabitants worshipping the false god Bögenauer. Still, I suppose it costs us nothing to be certain darker forces are not at work. It has been too long since my last visit.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02":"Bögenhafen is assailed by plague. Lohner believes the Pactsworn are responsible, and this may indeed be true. I can feel my nose twitching, as it ever does when matters are amiss. An investigation is called for ... I will have the truth of this matter!","pwh_wp_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01":"Hah! The Bridge of Shadows readily betrays its unsanctioned origins by growing ever more unreliable. I lend no credence to the notion that the problem is external, and connected to a cluster of elven ruins. But I have been outvoted. Again.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02":"This 'Bridge of Shadows' we employ is increasingly unreliable. Lohner insists the source lies in the old elven ruins a few leagues from here. Naturally, the true cause of woe is that we rely on untrustworthy magic! But I suppose it can't hurt to investigate the ruins ...","pwh_wp_loading_screen_farmland_01":"The north empties of bloodthirsty heretics, and they waste their might on defenceless farmers. It was ever thus. The faithless lack understanding of true strength, but I shall teach them. Oh yes, I shall. Gladly.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_farmland_02":"The Pactsworn are nothing but cowards and blackguards! Why else would they waste their hel-spawned might on defenceless farmers? Fuegonasus insists we intervene and - though it troubles me greatly that this is so - I find myself in complete agreement.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01":"There are rumours of the ratmen building war engines beyond the walls. If uncontested, this will surely end badly for Helmgart, so an excursion into the forest seems called for. Perhaps the elf will actually prove useful here.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02":"The ratmen are building their damnable war engines out in the forest. This cannot be tolerated! But we must tread carefully. The forest holds many dangers, verminous or otherwise. Many a righteous man has lost his way in all that cursed greenery.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_fort_01":"Fort Brachsenbrücke is beset, and we are charged with rescuing its defenders from a most undesirable fate. Such heroics sit ill with me, I must confess, but if my humble deeds are required to restore the wavering faith of my countrymen, then I shall bear the plaudits gladly.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_fort_02":"Fort Brachsenbrücke's defenders have been lax, and call for aid. While it does no good to cosset the idle, nor can we afford Brachsenbrücke's fall, so I have magnanimously agreed to lead a relief effort to its walls. Sigmar grant that we arrive in time.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_ground_zero_01":"Lohner has received warning of a Rotblood sorcerer plying heretical mischief down in Helmgart's depths. Well! It has been some time since I was permitted to ... chastise ... a witch. Let the fellow quail to know Victor Saltzpyre hunts him now!","pwh_wp_loading_screen_ground_zero_02":"A Rotblood sorcerer is plying his foul trade down in Helmgart's ruins. The precise details of his scheme escape me, and in truth they matter not. He is a heretic, an invader and a northlander. For those crimes alone, I would gladly see him burn.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01":"Lohner's accomplice - that disrespectful Kislevite - has departed to spy on the ratmen. To aid her mission, we are to perform one of our own. By waking the bells at the Temple of Sigmar, we shall bring half the city's pactsworn down on us. Let them come.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02":"We are called upon to create a distraction by ringing the bells at the Temple of Sigmar. This is indeed a glorious and holy mission, for such sweet chimes will surely revive the fighting spirit of embattled Helmgart. Yes! I have a good feeling about this day. A change of fortunes is on the wind.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01":"Disaster! Ubersreik is besieged by ratmen! They do exist, though the occasion of undeniable proof could be happier. The alarm must be raised if the city is to be saved ... but these companions? Kruber will serve well enough, but the witch? The dwarf? The ... elf? Trying times lie ahead, I deem.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02":"Ubersreik is assailed! By ratmen! And the only companions I have to hand are a band of misfits only a fool would trust. Still, it is the burden of the faithful to forge on through less than ideal circumstances. The Horn of Magnus must be blown, and I shall see it done.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_mines_01":"Trolls cannot be counted among Sigmar's beloved creatures, but the specimens being bred in the mines are fouler even than the norm! Some heretical scheme of the Rotbloods, so Lohner insists. I confess, I needed little convincing to put these 'experiments' to an end ... ","pwh_wp_loading_screen_mines_02":"There are no limits to the northlanders' heresy! Even now, they are breeding an uglier, fouler strain of troll in the depths of a nearby mine. I will not allow such heresy to continue unabated! The mine must be purged, with fire and steel!","pwh_wp_loading_screen_nurgle_01":"I have heard the name Ghûlmagak mentioned in certain ... unholy texts. The Rotbloods must not be permitted to uncover even a portion of his might. They must be stopped; their bodies - and their cursed prize - returned to the mire forthwith!","pwh_wp_loading_screen_nurgle_02":"The Rotbloods have discovered some wretched, heretical artefact from ancient days. It is buried in the heart of a swamp, and I dread the consquences if they are permitted to claim their prize. This ... is a task for the righteous.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01":"Karak Gnol lies in ratman hands. Freeing it is, I fear, beyond our meagre numbers, but we can at least chastise the warlord who commands the nest. His broken corpse is certain to provoke a fresh struggle for supremacy, distracting the ratmen from our labours. At least for a time.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02":"The dwarfen stronghold of Karak Gnol lies in the festering grip of a ratman warlord, whom Lohner has marked for death. Old alliances aside, the warlord's fall is sure to bring about schism in the enemy ranks. We can exploit that ...","pwh_wp_loading_screen_skittergate_01":"Lohner believes that the ratman Skittergate is no longer guarded with unceasing vigilance. Hah! It is often the way that the faithless bring about their own destruction through laxity. So it shall be here, for our victory begins with the Skittergate's destruction.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_skittergate_02":"The ratmen have constructed a magical gateway in the bowels of Helmgart. It is from this portal that their faithless ranks receive endless reinforcement. But no longer. The hour has come in which it shall be destroyed. By my hand!","pwh_wp_loading_screen_ussingen_01":"Ussingen's baron's manor has been put to work as a provisions storehouse for the northlanders. We shall burn it all. For is it not said that a starving army is one already half-defeated? I confess ... I am looking forward to this little excursion.","pwh_wp_loading_screen_ussingen_02":"The heretical northlanders are using the town of Ussingen as a stockpile, from which they provision their campaigns. This, naturally, we shall not allow. It will all have to be burned. Let the northlanders eat the ashes, if they can stomach them.","pwh_wp_portals_briefing_01":"Castle Drachenfels. I have no desire to walk beneath its shadow a second time, but the Pactsworn have left me little choice. In recent days, there have been many abductions from the nearby villages, and someone must fight for those people.","pwh_wp_portals_briefing_02":"The Pactsworn have been abducting villagers in the shadow of Castle Drachenfels. A true servant of Sigmar knows no fear, but he should perhaps be wary - especially in such a place. But I have pledged my life to confronting evils.
