	"pbw_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_03": "We'll see to it, and burn everyone in our path!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_04": "Darlings? You heard the man.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_01": "(laugh) There's one! At last!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_02": "Well I never! Do you see that cage?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_03": "They're not all dead, darlings! One lives, at least!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_04": "Let's get that fellow free!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_01": "Darkness. Such a blunt portent.",

	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_03": "Yuck. What a mess. And the smell...",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_04": "The Pactsworn like darkness. It means they don't have to look at one another.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_finale_01": "Look at all this death! The ritual's good and fuelled, I'd say.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_finale_02": "This is no acolyte's ritual, darlings. Be on your guard.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_finale_03": "Blood calls to power. But what manner of power have the Pactsworn called upon?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entering_finale_04": "Look at this mess. Poor souls. I dread to think what the ritual has called forth.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entrance_01": "Are we sure we want to go down there. It looks like something's burrowed out?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entrance_02": "That's not a tunnel, darlings. It's a burrow!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entrance_03": "Alright, we can go down there, but don't blame me if something eats us.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_entrance_04": "Looks like something's chewed its way out.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_exiting_pbw_bastion_01": "I'll bet that sorcerer's fled to the castle.",

	"pbw_bastion_vo_exiting_pbw_bastion_03": "We can't leave that sorcerer buried in the castle. We'll have to come back.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_exiting_pbw_bastion_04": "There's the castle itself. We'll be back soon enough. That sorcerer has to burn!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_done_01": "The sorcerer's fled!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_done_02": "(laugh) That's right! Run away!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_done_03": "He's gone, darlings. And about time too.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_done_04": "Whew, that was a close one. I wonder where he's gone?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_missile_01": "Get off! You revolting little conjuration, you.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_missile_02": "His visitation's tracking me!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_missile_03": "This squalid little pus-ball won't leave me alone.",

	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_01": "Not so fast, fatty! Fire will burn you still!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_02": "Think you're above fire, do you? Think again!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_03": "There's always a speech, isn't there? Then screams. Let's get the screams started.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_04": "Sure of himself, isn't he?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_01": "He's tiring! So much for daemonic strength!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_02": "Look at that fatty! His strength's failing.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_03": "Doesn't look so confident now, does he?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_04": "He's weakening. Don't give up now!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_01": "Make for the surface!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_02": "Is it too much to ask for us to get aboveground?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_03": "Cinderspit! What I wouldn't give for open skies.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_04": "Up, darlings! Up! It's horrible down here.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_01": "Deserted. Just our luck.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_02": "Are we too late? Again? Unacceptable!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_03": "There were prisoners here. ",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_04": "There were folk here recently, darlings. But not now.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_01": "We'll keep moving. There's nothing we can do here.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_02": "Not a one. A bad day.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_03": "Volans! Not a single villager.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_04": "Ashes and Ruin! This place is deserted.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_possessed_01": "Look out! They're possessed!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_possessed_02": "These Pactsworn fight with sorcerous strength!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_possessed_03": "They've gone mad! Watch yourselves, darlings!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_possessed_04": "They've gone berserk!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_search_cells_01": "Check the cells!",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_search_cells_02": "A prison? Yoo-hoo! Anyone there?",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_search_cells_03": "Look around, darlings. I think we've found the prison.",
	"pbw_bastion_vo_search_cells_04": "Search every cell. We can't leave anyone behind.",
	"pbw_bell_intro_a_01": "It's said their bells can be charged with a monstrous level of Skaven magic. We can't have that can we?",
	"pbw_bell_intro_a_02": "Like Lohner said, where the ratmen go, you can count on a cursed bell hanging somewhere.",
	"pbw_bell_intro_b_01": "When we get there, make sure to wreck that odious thing quickly. Even Imperial bells give me a headache.",
	"pbw_bell_intro_b_02": "If the ratties want a bell, that's reason enough to take it away, darlings.",
	"pbw_bell_intro_c_01": "How about we move a little quicker and talk a little less for once? Haven't burned anything in minutes.",
	"pbw_bell_intro_c_02": "Way I feel, I could scour Helmgart clean with beautiful, elegant flames. Lead on!",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_eight_01": "It could be worse, darlings. He seems more at ease than ever ... in his own way.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_five_01": "Is it me, or does Saltzpyre seem a bit cheerier these days?",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_nine_01": "Oh, I do hope not. Think how insufferable Saltzpyre will be.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_seven_01": "Saltzpyre seems to have found his fire again.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_six_01": "True, but these days he's clearer on who the enemy is. Speaking for myself, it's definitely an improvement.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_six_02": "Steady, Markus. You can go too far.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentyfive_01": "Very kind, but I'm not one for being embraced by men with beards. If you can call that a beard.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentyfour_01": "So ... In all your little chats with Sigmar, did he not pass comment on you being friends with a witch?",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentyfour_02": "Such as?",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentyfour_03": "How very poetic. Are you certain Kerillian's not been putting those 'special herbs' in your food again?",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentyone_01": "You know, I'm sure you've become more insufferable since your little experience in the north.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentyone_02": "And that's exactly what an insufferable man would say.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentythree_01": "It seems we're all finding religion these days. Me with Myrmidia. Markus with his pantheon--",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentythree_02": "And why not? I'd make a fabulous Goddess of Incineration, so why hold back with Markus? And you claim to speak with Sigmar's voice. In some traditions, that would make you his son.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentythree_03": "Don't knock what you haven't tried, Saltzpyre. You never know ... you might like it.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentytwo_01": "You seem happier to have heard Sigmar's voice, Saltzpyre. But I do wish you'd stop trying to smile.",
	"pbw_bless_conversation_twentytwo_02": "Not especially. But you do keep scaring the cats.",
	"pbw_bright_weave_conversation_one_01": "Now this is more like it! Isn't it glorious?",
	"pbw_bright_weave_conversation_two_01": "I think it's lovely, darling. So warm. So comforting. *contented sigh*",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_four_01": "So many stories about this place. The Poison Feast. Undead. Daemons... Wasn't there some kind of play set and performed here?",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_four_02": "Hypothetically speaking, of course.",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_nine_01": "Keep a sharp watch, Bardin. I'm relying on you to warn me of any more traps.",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_nine_02": "Oh, don't worry. I'm keeping a sharp watch too.",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_one_01": "I'm more concerned about the size of the spiders.",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_six_01": "It's a simple enough enchantment, Markus. A bit of Grey magic, and a smidge of Gold. \"Devious\" comes naturally to some.",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_six_02": "Of course not. Fire plays no games, and no favourites.",
	"pbw_castle_conversation_twelve_01": "Ignore it, Markus. It's your imagination.",
	"pbw_castle_intro_line_a_01": "So, the sorcerer's hiding in Castle Drachenfels? Ha! Well that won't work.",
	"pbw_castle_intro_line_a_02": "This sorcerer has some ego, claiming Castle Drachenfels for his own!",
	"pbw_castle_intro_line_b_01": "Let's not be reckless, darlings. We don't know what's waiting.",
	"pbw_castle_intro_line_b_02": "This might get challenging, darlings. Traps. Ambushes. That sort of thing.",
	"pbw_castle_intro_line_c_01": "Don't worry. While we've fire, they'll have screams... agony... all that good stuff.",
	"pbw_castle_intro_line_c_02": "We'll manage, darlings. Don't we always?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_01": "He's in there. I can smell him.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_02": "That stench... This is the place.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_03": "Are we ready darlings?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_04": "Time to wipe that smile off his bloated face, darlings.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blockage_01": "We'll have to clear this blockage.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blockage_02": "Can we clear the path?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blockage_03": "We can't go further until this lot's cleared.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blockage_04": "What a mess. Can we get through?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blood_pool_01": "Blood. Blood. Blood. What's wrong with a little flame?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blood_pool_02": "Don't track that blood around the place.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blood_pool_03": "Watch where you're walking. Those gargoyles may not be as sleepy as they seem.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_blood_pool_04": "A splash of blood really livens the place up, don't you think?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_01": "Nurgloth wasn't the master, but the servant. We need to breach the crypt and kill the daemon.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_02": "We're not done, darlings. We need to kill Nurgloth's daemonic master in the crypt.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_03": "This isn't over until we banish the daemon Nurgloth called up.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_04": "This isn't over until we batter Nurgloth's daemon into submission. We need to explore the crypt.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_01": "It's odd. I feel like we've missed something.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_02": "Darlings... does anyone else feel like we've missed something?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_03": "I don't think we're finished here, but I don't know why.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_04": "Arrgghhh... Something's not right, but I don't know what!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_door_open_01": "Well, that's not at all spooky.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_door_open_02": "It seems we're expected, darlings.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_door_open_03": "I like a nice, warm welcome as much as anyone, but this one leaves me cold.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_door_open_04": "Well, at least they're polite enough to open the door.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_01": "Hang on... This bit's new...",
	"pbw_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_02": "This doesn't look right.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_03": "Was this here before?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_04": "Darlings...? Does any of this look odd to you?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_drop_down_01": "Must we subject ourselves to another plunge, darlings?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_drop_down_02": "Down there? Well, I suppose it didn't kill us last time.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_drop_down_03": "Down there? If we must, we must.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_drop_down_04": "Oh really? Is there no other way out?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_enter_01": "It'll have to be this door, darlings.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_enter_02": "That door looks like our best option.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_enter_03": "That door should lead us deeper.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_enter_04": "Through that door perhaps, darlings?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_01": "Had we better head back upstairs, darlings?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_02": "I didn't come all this way to lurch around in the cellar.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_03": "We'll have to get back upstairs.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_04": "Ashes and Ruin! Now we have to find a route back up!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_halls_01": "That's better. We're back in the castle.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_halls_02": "Is this the castle again? Good.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_halls_03": "Never thought I'd be glad to be back in the castle.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_halls_04": "This looks like the castle, darlings. We're back in the right place.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_hello_01": "Hello? Hello-o?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_hello_02": "It's as though no one wants to play. I think I'll pout.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_hello_03": "The door's open, but there's no one home.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_hello_04": "I think they're hiding, darlings.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_landed_01": "Well, that wasn't very ladylike...",
	"pbw_castle_vo_landed_02": "Now I know how an apple feels when it falls from the tree.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_landed_03": "Oh yes, pull that switch. Well that was a bright idea.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_landed_04": "No one say a word. Not. One. Word.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_01": "Majestically put. Allow me to offer rebuttal...",
	"pbw_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_02": "Come, flames! Sizzle this bag of flatulent pus!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_03": "I don't think so! Flames, to me!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_04": "Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_recognize_01": "I recognise this bit.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_recognize_02": "This is definitely familiar.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_recognize_03": "We have been here before... I think.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_recognize_04": "So many memories. So many screams.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_search_again_01": "Hell-o? Where are you, sorcerer?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_search_again_02": "That sorcerer has to be around here somewhere, darlings.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_search_again_03": "We'll find that sorcerer sooner or later, darlings.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_search_again_04": "If I were a fat, smelly sorcerer, where would I hide?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_secret_door_01": "Oh. A secret door. That's more like it.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_secret_door_02": "A secret door. How exciting!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_secret_door_03": "Ooh. A secret door. Now all we need's a mournful harpsichord, or some mad laughter.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_secret_door_04": "There we go. I never doubted for a moment.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_01": "Another braggart gone.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_02": "They never learn, do they darlings?",

	"pbw_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_04": "You know, if it were me, I'd be waiting in the throne room.",

	"pbw_castle_vo_trap_switch_03": "A switch. Or is it a trap?",
	"pbw_castle_vo_trap_switch_04": "Don't pull that switch!",
	"pbw_castle_vo_vista_01": "It looks so peaceful. Not one fire. Boo.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_vista_02": "Isn't it lovely? A bit boring for my tastes, but I suppose some folk like it.",
	"pbw_castle_vo_vista_03": "Say what you like about the Great Enchanter, he knew where to find a good view.",

	"pbw_chaos_war_camp_intro_b_01": "Don't let it worry you, darling. I'll just torch everyone in the camp. That should do it.",
	"pbw_chaos_war_camp_intro_b_02": "Northlanders burn. What more do you want?",
	"pbw_chaos_war_camp_intro_c_01": "By Volans! Are you lot going to prattle all day? Talk with violence and force.",
	"pbw_chaos_war_camp_intro_c_02": "Talk, talk, talk. We've killing to do!",
	"pbw_chaos_war_camp_taunt_payback_reply_01": "Oh yes, we did it all. And you know what? We enjoyed it! Put that in your pipe and smoke it, bog-botherer!",

	"pbw_cog_conversation_eleven_02": "Oh ... that sounds onerous. ",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_nine_01": "Don't take this wrong, but the tinkerer's trade seems to require a certain ... delicate touch.",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_nine_02": "Glad to hear it! Though the way you stomp about the place, I'd never have guessed.",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_seven_01": "So you're an engineer now, is that right Bardin?",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_seven_02": "Good. Repression's bad for the spirit. I never repress anything.",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_ten_01": "I don't know why, but I feel like we've more in common now, Bardin. I think it's the explosions.",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_ten_02": "Oh, I don't mind. I thought it looked rather impressive. But I do think Lohner would have preferred that outbuilding intact.",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_twelve_01": "You're not tempted to go back to Karak Norn and join the Engineer's Guild, Bardin?",
	"pbw_cog_conversation_twelve_02": "Good strange, or bad strange?",

	"pbw_comet_conversation_two_01": "Hmmm... A great big flaming ball of death in the sky? I'm for it.",
	"pbw_comet_conversation_two_02": "What of them?",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_done_01": "Beastmen? Well, as long as they burn, I'm content.",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_done_02": "I know I keep saying I'm bored of burning ratties, darlings, but this isn't what I had in mind.",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_done_03": "You know, it's been years since I immolated a beastman. Happy times.",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_done_04": "Beastmen now, is it? It'll be daemons next, you mark my words.",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_interactable_01": "Anything about this seem a little... off, darlings?",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_interactable_02": "Someone got the rat ogre before I could. I think I'm annoyed, darlings.",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_interactable_03": "What's been going on here?",
	"pbw_crater_ambush_interactable_04": "Well, that's not a sight you see often... at least, not before we've gone to work.",
	"pbw_crater_arena_end_01": "We're alive! But the world has changed... I can... see it.",
	"pbw_crater_arena_end_02": "We may have miscalculated. Something strange has happened.",
	"pbw_crater_arena_end_03": "We did it, darlings! Actually, I think we might have done more than we meant to...",
	"pbw_crater_arena_end_04": "Don't be quick to celebrate, darlings. Something's wrong...",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_01": "That standard's grounding the magic! Destroy it, darlings!",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_02": "The standard channels the magic! ",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_02_01": "There's another standard!",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_02_02": "Another standard?",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_02_03": "Time to destroy standard number two, darlings!",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_02_04": "Darlings? See that second standard?",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_03": "The standard's part of the ritual. Give it a knock or two!",
	"pbw_crater_arena_standard_04": "You see that standard? That's what we need to destroy.",
	"pbw_crater_arena_waystone_01": "My head's clamouring. Let's go home.",
	"pbw_crater_arena_waystone_02": "I have eight winds shouting for attention... I need a rest.",
	"pbw_crater_arena_waystone_03": "I need to speak with Olesya. This isn't right...",
	"pbw_crater_arena_waystone_04": "I don't like how this ended, darlings. It feels like... unfinished business.",
	"pbw_crater_bridge_sighted_01": "We can use that tree as a bridge.",
	"pbw_crater_bridge_sighted_02": "You see that tree, darlings? That'll get us across.",
	"pbw_crater_bridge_sighted_03": "We can cross the chasm using that tree.",
	"pbw_crater_bridge_sighted_04": "There's a tree bridging the chasm. That might work for us.",
	"pbw_crater_climb_top_01": "I hear voices, darlings. They're not saying anything good.",
	"pbw_crater_climb_top_02": "Sounds like a ritual. Not the good kind, if you're wondering.",
	"pbw_crater_climb_top_03": "The beastmen are harnessing the meteor's power. That's not good.",
	"pbw_crater_climb_top_04": "The beastmen are definitely using the warpstone for something... unpleasant.",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_eight_01": "You sure you're on our side, Markus? After all, Taal worship's only a stone's throw from these beasties...",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_five_01": "Your people have a long history with the beastmen, Kerillian?",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_five_02": "That's hardly fair. The Empire's overrun with the brutes.",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_nine_01": "So, these minotaurs? What are they? A larger kind of beastmen? Some other sort of mutated monster?",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_nine_02": "Of course he does, Bardin. Imaginary friends know everything.",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_two_01": "Hush, Saltzpyre. We all know you're only happy when you're killing.",
	"pbw_crater_conversation_two_02": "With help. Consider me the lesser of two evils. Can't say I care for the smelly brutes either.",
	"pbw_crater_devastation_01": "Is it wrong that I find so much rampant devastation a little... thrilling?",
	"pbw_crater_devastation_02": "I'm not saying this isn't horrible, darlings... But isn't it also a little... glorious?",
	"pbw_crater_devastation_03": "There's a strange beauty to so much devastation, isn't there? *defensive* What?",
	"pbw_crater_devastation_04": "Imagine the power it takes to do this... Makes you go weak at the knees, doesn't it?",
	"pbw_crater_forest_ascent_top_01": "We can't be far from the meteor now. Keep searching for a way forward.",
	"pbw_crater_forest_ascent_top_02": "There has to be a way through. We can't give up now.",
	"pbw_crater_forest_ascent_top_03": "Darlings? We can't keep lurking around here, fun as it is. We need to find a way through.",
	"pbw_crater_forest_ascent_top_04": "If I remember Lohner's instructions, we're still on the wrong side of the mountains.",
	"pbw_crater_intro_banter_a_01": "We've come a long way, darlings. I wonder what for?",
	"pbw_crater_intro_banter_a_02": "A long way from home. I wish Lohner had been more specific.",
	"pbw_crater_intro_banter_b_01": "Here am I, out in the wilds, on an innkeeper's hunch. How wonderful life is, darlings.",
	"pbw_crater_intro_banter_b_02": "The trouble with Lohner is he always thinks he's right. Doesn't help that he often is, of course.",
	"pbw_crater_intro_banter_c_01": "The sooner we take a look around and find nothing, the sooner we can go home.",
	"pbw_crater_intro_banter_c_02": "There's nothing to find. I promise you that, darlings.",
	"pbw_crater_plan_banter_a_01": "Right! No more lollygagging! We need a bold plan, and Aunty Sienna has one. Beastman wards are feeble things. If we disrupt the ritual...",
	"pbw_crater_plan_banter_a_02": "Don't everyone cheer at once, I've thought of a plan. If we can disrupt that shoddy ritual...",
	"pbw_crater_plan_banter_b_01": "...the magic will snap loose. With a bit of luck, the warpstone will implode. I like it! But, there is a snag...",
	"pbw_crater_plan_banter_b_02": "...the magic will go wild! Oh, won't that be fun for all concerned. Imploded warpstone isn't much harm. Well, there is a little harm...",
	"pbw_crater_plan_banter_c_01": "...yes, yes, yes, we're all going to die. But everyone dies, darlings!",
	"pbw_crater_plan_banter_c_02": "...so we're all going to die? Hah! If I had a bottle of brandy for every time I'd heard that.",
	"pbw_crater_rim_vista_01": "So much for stealing the warpstone. We'll never move a chunk that size without going mad.",
	"pbw_crater_rim_vista_02": "I hate to say it, darlings, but this might be too much for us. I don't see how we're to deal with that warpstone.",
	"pbw_crater_rim_vista_03": "Ah... There's more warpstone than I thought. Too much for us to handle. I'm not sure what we're to do.",
	"pbw_crater_rim_vista_04": "That's more warpstone than I expected, darlings. There's no stealing that. We'll have to think of something else.",
	"pbw_crater_tracking_camp_01": "This doesn't look like a skaven camp...",
	"pbw_crater_tracking_camp_02": "Have a care, darlings. There might be more lurking close by.",
	"pbw_crater_tracking_camp_03": "Well, ratties, is it? No change there.",
	"pbw_crater_tracking_camp_04": "Rats wherever we tread, darlings. Might be nice to have a change of pace once in a while.",
	"pbw_crater_vista_reveal_01": "Volans! The sky's alive with magic. It must have drawn the beastmen.",
	"pbw_crater_vista_reveal_02": "That's not good, darlings. The sky shouldn't be swarming with magic.",
	"pbw_crater_vista_reveal_03": "That's not natural, darlings. There's magic loose over there. A lot of it.",
	"pbw_crater_vista_reveal_04": "The eight winds are blowing strong. They must have drawn the beastmen.",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_intro_01": "This isn't just any meteor. Warpstone! We can't let the beastmen have it!",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_intro_02": "People lived down there, darlings. I shudder to think how many that meteor killed. We must recover the warpstone before things get worse.",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_intro_03": "A warpstone meteor! So many dead. I can see the remains of at least one village. We can't let their deaths count for nothing.",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_intro_04": "We've had a warpstone strike, that explains a lot. That poor village. Still, we can at least neutralise the warpstone... or steal it.",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_tree_push_01": "Give that tree a kick, would you?",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_tree_push_02": "We'll have to make our own bridge here.",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_tree_push_03": "We need to cross. Can that tree help us out, darlings?",
	"pbw_crater_wasteland_tree_push_04": "No way across. What about that tree?",
	"pbw_crawl_cheers_01": "Health to all, and confusion to our enemies!",
	"pbw_crawl_cheers_02": "Flames for everyone! Yes!",
	"pbw_crawl_cheers_03": "Who, um, fancies a little dance, darlings?",
	"pbw_crawl_cheers_04": "I love you all! Yes, even you, you cantankerous little devil. Give me a hug!",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_nine_01": "Oh, she's gone. I didn't know you had a horse. Didn't you come to Ubersreik by carriage, back in the day?",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_nine_02": "True. He did roast Lohner's donkey.",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_six_01": "So we have... I must say, I never thought I'd take to a dwarf, but you're a fine fellow.",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_six_02": "Not much to be done about that, I'm afraid.",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_three_01": "You should have another drink, Markus. You're too sober...",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_three_02": "What's that, dear Markus? You can tell me.",
	"pbw_crawl_conversation_two_01": "What are you doing, Saltzpyre?",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_01": "Drinky! At last!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_02": "Oh, that burns nicely!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_03": "A fiery drop! I can feel it doing me good!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_04": "Drinky! Drinky! Drinky!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_05": "Darlings! You have to try this one!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_06": "Oh, I like that one.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_01": "Oh, my aching head. But don't you taste good, yes you do.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_02": "That's stoked the flames, darlings. I feel much better!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_03": "Nothing like a little drinky to fuel the fires.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_04": "That's the stuff. I can feel my fingers again.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_05": "That's a bit better.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_06": "You know, I feel almost like my old self.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_01": "Ashes and ruin, but I'm tired.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_02": "YAWN",

	"pbw_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_02": "Who's that over there?",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_03": "You in the shadows! Bring me a drinky or begone!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_04": "Something's coming. Maaaybe it's a tavern-keeper?",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_01": "Won't someone help a poor old woman stand up?",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_02": "Hello floor, my old friend.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_03": "Oh dear. I seem to have fallen over...",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_04": "Let me at 'em! I'll take them all on!",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_01": "Drinky?",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_02": "Drinky. That has to be a drinky.",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_03": "Drinky? Here, little drinky-drinky...",
	"pbw_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_04": "Is that a drinky? Hands off! It's mine!",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_01": "Is that a cask of Bugman's? Lovely.",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_02": "Don't leave that cask of Bugman's, darlings. It's the good stuff.",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_03": "Bugman's? Oh, we'll take that one with us and have a quiet drink back at the keep.",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_04": "Is that a whole cask of Bugman's? I call dibs, but I'll share it, if you're nice.",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_keep_quiet_01": "We're here for a drinky, not a brawl. Keep quiet!",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_keep_quiet_02": "Hush, darlings. Less killing, more peace, more drinky, yes?",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_keep_running_01": "Faster, darlings, faster!",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_keep_running_02": "Keep going! ",

	"pbw_crawl_end_event_way_open_01": "I suppose we could leave through the cellar...",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_way_open_02": "(sigh) Alright, darlings. If we have to leave, we could try the cellar.",
	"pbw_crawl_end_event_way_open_03": "Out through the cellar it is.",

	"pbw_crawl_pub_district_sign_03": "This all looks familiar. Of course, it was on fire the last time I was here.",
	"pbw_crawl_pub_district_sign_04": "Yes, sweet flame, we're almost there now. I can taste it already.",
	"pbw_crawl_pub_door_01": "Where's the door?",

	"pbw_crawl_pub_horde_end_02": "Yes, sweet flame. Now they're dead, we can find that drinky.",
	"pbw_crawl_pub_horde_end_03": "Listen, pactsworn - never come between a fire-maven and her drink! Oh, never mind.",
	"pbw_crawl_pub_horde_end_04": "That was fun - I'm not saying it wasn't - but I'm still parched.",
	"pbw_crawl_shortcut_01": "Care for a promenade through the park, darlings?",

	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_01": "There it is! Why's it so small? Oh, it's far away.",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_02": "I think I see the tavern, darlings. Last one there buys the drinks!",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_03": "There's the Hungry Troll! Not a sentence I normally say with a smile on my face.",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_04": "There's the tavern. Why's it still so far away? It's not fair.",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_01": "Poot! How are we going to get there now?",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_02": "Oh, this is ridiculous, darlings. ",

	"pbw_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_04": "I don't believe it. More complications.",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_second_pub_01": "The Feuerblümchen! No! What happened here?",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_second_pub_02": "Stop looking at me like that! I didn't do this!",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_second_pub_03": "And old Heike said the place was fireproof. Guess he was wrong, darlings.",
	"pbw_crawl_spot_second_pub_04": "No, sweet flame. We didn't do this. At least, I don't think we did.",

	"pbw_gameplay_response_149": "Can I help it if the beasts despise fire?",

	"pbw_gameplay_response_154": "We'll find you one after all this, Bardin. I promise.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_155": "And to eat one, so I hear?",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_156": "I barely saw you take aim, Kerillian. Impressive.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_157": "Not evil at all, Victor. But dangerous, all the same.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_158": "Gracious as ever, Kerillian.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_159": "More or less.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_16": "Not on my account. Someone help me up!",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_160": "It means 'don't get hit'.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_161": "Why, thank you, sergeant.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_162": "You dodged that blow. Did you not see?",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_163": "You sound almost glad.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_164": "Any takers, darlings? Didn't think so.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_165": "I'll take whatever margin I'm allowed.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_166": "They do seem a bit clingy.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_167": "For that, I have to breathe.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_168": "Then keep a sharper watch. It's not like those tentacles are difficult to spot.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_169": "Can't say I enjoy their attention.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_17": "It's no place for any of us, Kruber.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_170": "I'm trying!",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_171": "Crazy as a firebug...",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_172": "Don't speak too harshly, Saltzpyre. Bound to be your turn soon.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_173": "Still convinced I'm damned, Saltzpyre?",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_174": "Chaos Spawn never do, despite their agonies.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_175": "I hate Spawn. They stink of tainted magic.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_176": "It was a pleasure, believe me.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_177": "Yes, because not a one of us laid a single blow.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_178": "Nothing clean about that Spawn. Nothing at all.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_179": "Better that than being carried away by the Spawn.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_180": "And not before time. Writhing horror!",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_181": "Might be that's best with a Spawn.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_182": "To ash, Goreksson! Count on it!",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_183": "Nothing much can, not if it's mortal.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_184": "And the Spawn felt it soon after.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_185": "I'm heartbroken. I thought I could keep it as a pet.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_186": "I wish that were true.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_187": "And this time, right when a Spawn ran amok. I'll drink to that.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_188": "Flame is a great leveller, Saltzpyre.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_19": "Well, we can't all be elves, can we?",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_199": "Ah, like a pirate crew. Wouldn't mind joining one someday.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_21": "Oh shut up, you narcissist nag.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_22": "Oh, I don't doubt that.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_23": "Oh but that's why I wriggled free.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_24": "I think my fires draw them.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_25": "So charming, Goreksson.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_26": "I need to breathe for that, idiot!",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_33": "...you, Saltzpyre!",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_35": "Thanks for your concern.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_36": "You're not helping.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_37": "Well fought, Saltzpyre.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_38": "It's a gift that doesn't fade with use.",
	"pbw_gameplay_response_39": "You actually fear that might be true, don't you?",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_cairn_gate_01": "Cairn Gate, darlings!",

	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_02": "Does no-one else see that Spawn?",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_03": "Nasty, lumpen and brutish. Does that Spawn not remind you of someone else?",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_04": "Just once, I'd like to see Lohner deal with something like that Spawn.",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_05": "There, Chaos Spawn!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_06": "Don't let that Spawn grab you, darlings!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_07": "Looks like someone's fallen from favour!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_spawn_08": "Revolting! But it'll burn like the rest!",

	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_05": "Chaos Warrior! He'll blaze like a torch!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_06": "Don't let up! We've a Chaos Warrior to kill!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_07": "A Chaos Warrior! To me, Aqshy's flames!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_08": "Ha! I'll melt that armour, you'll see!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_champion_combat_01": "Chaos Champion? They're upping the ante.",

	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_champion_combat_03": "That Champion might be a problem...",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_champion_combat_04": "Keep the Champion back! Give me a clear shot!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_champion_combat_05": "Oh, my darling Champion, I've a flameburst just for you...",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_champion_combat_06": "See that rot-helm Champion? Do something about him!",
	"pbw_gameplay_seeing_a_chaos_warrior_champion_combat_07": "Look yonder! A rot-helm Champion's coming for us!",

	"pbw_level_bell_distance_02": "Better walk faster, darlings. The bell's a fair way off.",
	"pbw_level_bell_effect_01": "See those ratties, darlings? Driven to frenzy by the horrid chimes.",
	"pbw_level_bell_effect_02": "Each strike of the bell sends them into a frenzy, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_exit_01": "We should find our portal, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_exit_02": "Lohner said the portal was below.",
	"pbw_level_bell_falling_01": "Now, that's a grand finale, darlings! We know how to make an impact!",
	"pbw_level_bell_falling_02": "Oh, yes! That paid off, darlings. It damn well did.",
	"pbw_level_bell_horde_01": "The bell tolling means hordes come running, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_horde_02": "Expect a horde every time that foul instrument chimes, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_long_stairs_01": "These stairs... ugh, should have learnt some levitation magic.",
	"pbw_level_bell_long_stairs_02": "Ooff, more stairs? I've a good mind to stay here.",
	"pbw_level_bell_poor_quarters_01": "Dread to think how many were crammed in here, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_poor_quarters_02": "Awful! Can you imagine living around here?",
	"pbw_level_bell_rain_01": "Who ordered a downpour? Pretty sure it wasn't me.",
	"pbw_level_bell_rain_02": "Cold and wet. Not my idea of a good time, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_reaching_bell_01": "Whew! At last. Time for the best part. The bell busting part.",
	"pbw_level_bell_reaching_bell_02": "There were are. Who's a good bell, ready for a thumping?",
	"pbw_level_bell_rich_quarters_01": "Now, this is more like it. I'd live here, 'till it burned down.",
	"pbw_level_bell_rich_quarters_02": "Fancier end of town, by the looks.",
	"pbw_level_bell_rooftops_01": "Well, at least we've a view from up here.",
	"pbw_level_bell_rooftops_02": "I think this bit right here will finally earn me the title of qualified roof-runner. Dreams do come true, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_spotting_01": "There it is. Still a bit a of a walk, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bell_spotting_02": "We're getting closer. Up for another push, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_bell_vista_01": "Miserable sight. All that rain.",
	"pbw_level_bell_vista_02": "Helmgart's not at its best in the rain, is it?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_01": "Well? Where's this cursed sword darlings?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_02": "Anyone see the Blightreaper?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_03": "Now, where's the Blightreaper? I hope it's here after all this trouble.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_04": "Find the Blightreaper, darlings. Find it!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_blocked_01": "No way through. What luck!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_blocked_02": "We're not getting through that lot, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_blocked_03": "Well, that's just typical, but you know what they say: Head into the sewers, expect a big pile of crap.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_blocked_04": "I hope someone brought a shovel, and a desire to get dirty hands.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_01": "Set the brazier, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_02": "Put a light to that brazier, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_03": "Can we light that brazier? Shed a bit of brightness on the murk.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_04": "We need more light.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_01": "Well, that's one less hypocrite in the world...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_02": "Didn't get very far, did he?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_03": "Should have chosen fire over faith, priest.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_04": "Well, that answers what happened to Kraussman...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_01": "Can't say I like what they're done with the place...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_02": "Looks like Grandfather Nurgle's been redecorating.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_03": "Well, this is foul, isn't it?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_04": "Not a good look for a Temple of Sigmar, is it?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_01": "Which way to the waystone, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_02": "They'll not let us go easily, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_03": "They'll be coming, but we'll lead them a merry dance yet.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_04": "Come along, darlings. We should head home.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_01": "A locked gate, and no key. We'll have to find the priest.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_02": "Where's this Kraussman? The old fool's only locked the gate!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_03": "No key, and no priest. I'm sure we'll find the one with the other.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_04": "Locked tight, darlings. Maybe Father Kraussman has the key?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_01": "There's something off about that sword - someone's been trying to change the enchantment.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_02": "Come to Aunty Sienna, little sword. Can't wait to try my fires on you.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_03": "It's ours now, darlings. Wait... who's been playing games with the enchantment?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_04": "Doesn't look like much, does it? And someone's been meddling with the magic. I wonder why?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_01": "Look at that, darlings! A skeleton with three legs. Necromancers can't count.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_02": "Used to know a song about a three-legged skeleton. No, that's not right. It was more of a filthy ditty.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_03": "Well, that's a sight you don't often see outside a freakshow.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_04": "Looks like a goblin, from the size of it. Then again, they normally come with two legs.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_01": "Oh goody! Something to burn!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_02": "Ready, darlings? I hope so.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_03": "Picking on a old woman, pact-sworn? For shame!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_04": "Let them come! Let them burn!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_01": "And Lohner thought the poor were to blame. Look at this place.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_02": "We're getting warmer, darlings. The Adel Ring's the source, for sure.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_03": "Look at all that! I'd say we've found the source, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_04": "Want to bet the Blightreaper's in amongst that lot, darlings? No? Nor me.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_01": "So it's a sword that's causing Bögenhafen's ills? No matter. Steel melts if the flame is fierce.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_02": "All this over a sword... Well, live and learn, I suppose.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_b_01": "I've heard whispers of the Chaos runeswords. Supposed to be seven, all told. And all of them corrupting in influence.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_b_02": "Gormann used to whisper about the Chaos runeswords... But he used to shout about the Blightreaper.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_c_01": "We'd better find this priest of Lohner's. Father Kraussman, was it?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_c_02": "Let's hope Father Kraussman can help us. Let's hope he's still alive.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_01": "This is no time for sightseeing...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_02": "What? Do you want to stick around? Suit yourselves.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_03": "Faster, darlings, faster.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_04": "Can't we go any faster? We're not popular hereabouts, or had you missed that?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_01": "Sounds like someone's having a good time, darlings? Never mind, I brought my own fireworks!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_02": "Do Bögenhafeners always celebrate their town sliding into the mire?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_03": "Lots of racket, lots of ratties... and here's us, with nothing to celebrate and plenty to kill!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_04": "We're missing the party, darlings. Never mind. We'll make do.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_01": "Someone find a switch.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_02": "We should find those switches, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_03": "Find those switches!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_04": "Look for a switch.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_01": "Flame guide us to one more victory.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_02": "By the Burning Beard, this is the last one.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_03": "Next one and we're out of here.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_04": "Just one more!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_01": "Where is the switch?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_02": "Looks like we have another switch to activate.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_03": "Who's doing the switch this time?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_04": "We've got it. Now find the other blasted thing!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_01": "It's raining again. I think I hate the Empire.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_02": "The skies are unhappy, and that makes me unhappy.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_03": "Even the rain smells funny in Bögenhafen tonight.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_04": "Ugh! And now I'm all wet.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_01": "Hark at them, cheering the night away.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_02": "Carousing while their town's beset? For shame.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_03": "Not sure why we're bothered about Bögenhafen, darlings. It's own folk sure aren't.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_04": "Cheery bunch, aren't they? Ignorance, or desperation?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_01": "Where's this sanctum? Hidden behind artifice, I reckon.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_02": "The Sanctum Maleficarum is close, darlings. Look for a hidden door.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_03": "The sanctum is near. Lohner spoke of a sequence of levers that would clear the way.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_04": "Of course the sanctum is hidden. You wouldn't leave its contents lying around, would you?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_01": "Lots of madman's scribbles in here...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_02": "All these books, and not one bawdy romance to be seen.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_03": "Never trust a wizard who writes things down, darlings. Means their mind's going.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_04": "Might even be the odd useful tome in here, but I'll bet there's no time to search.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_01": "I don't like all this sneaking around, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_02": "The back way in, again? Boring.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_03": "Tramping around in mud? I'm too old for this, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_04": "Whose idea was this? They can clean my boots afterwards.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_01": "Nice to see our fires are still blazing, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_02": "Look at that. The fire's still going.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_03": "Pit's still blazing nicely, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_04": "Dearie me. Looks like that fire of ours has run out of control! Ha!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eight_01": "Real witches, Saltzpyre? Or the convenient kind?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_story_five_01": "Lohner's too cagey with his information. It'll cost him one day.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_story_four_01": "So, this Grungni Ironheart - was he just mad, or a proper deviant?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_story_four_02": "Oh come on, you can't leave it at that. Details, Bardin. I like a bit of gossip.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_story_three_01": "Knowing Bardin, a lack of good ale on tap.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_story_two_01": "Words, Saltzpyre? Doesn't sound like you.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_01": "Come on, come on, come on. We've little time.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_02": "Faster, darlings. We can't afford delay.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_03": "Hurry up, lazybones.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_04": "Come on, pick up the pace darlings. Nurgle won't wait 'til you're ready.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_01": "Well, I guess we're off to the temple again.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_02": "Let's hope that's the right key, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_03": "That'll deal with the gate, darlings, but there'll be worse inside.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_04": "What are we waiting for? Back to the temple.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_01": "Someone bring the torch.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_02": "You lot might want that torch.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_03": "The torch. You don't want to leave that behind.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_04": "Light in the darkness, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_01": "Looks like our dance partners did us a favour.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_02": "They've made us an exit. Almost feel bad for burning them now.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_03": "Silly pact-sworn, making the fearsome intruders an exit.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_04": "And the wall comes down. Thank you, dung-for-brains.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_01": "Tarnus! Here they come, cheeky little mites!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_02": "We're ambushed! Let's hope the air's not as flammable as it smells!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_03": "Aha! So they want to bathe in the warmth of Aunty Sienna's affections?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_04": "Time to stand and fight, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_01": "Best that we burn it all. What a shame.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_02": "You think we should burn it? What am I saying? Of course we should burn it.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_03": "Now this is a problem that fire can solve. Fire's versatile like that.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_04": "We'll have to burn it, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_01": "Cannon. Wall. What say that one solves our problem with the other?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_02": "Don't know how they got that cannon down here. I'm just glad they did.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_03": "A cannon? In here. Someone was a hoarder. Does it still go bang?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_04": "We need a quick exit darlings. Let's use the cannon.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_01": "Well, that was a fine waste of time, wasn't it?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_02": "Off home, and with little to show for our efforts.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_03": "Well, at least we learnt something. Lohner will know what to do next.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_04": "Made a botch of that one, didn't we darlings?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_01": "I don't want to be a bother, darlings, but we should be running.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_02": "Run, darlings, unless you want to join the Black Hooks in death!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_03": "Let's show them our heels, darlings. Before they show us our innards.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_04": "Well, we have their attention... Run!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_01": "There we go. Wasn't too hard to find after all, was it?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_02": "This is what we're after, darlings. After you.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_03": "Should've known. Just like the Marienburg hideout.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_04": "This is the hideout. Assuming it's the one we're seeking.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_01": "They've got the advantage. We need somewhere to hole up.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_02": "Barricade that room, darlings. We'll fight from there.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_03": "They're everywhere. We need to change the terms of the fight.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_04": "They're getting a bit grabby, darlings. Is there anywhere we can hole up? Thin their approach?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_01": "Close up those windows, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_02": "We can at least hammer those windows shut!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_03": "Too many windows... But we can soon fix that!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_04": "Swiftly now, darlings! Get those windows battened up!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_01": "Eugh! The smell...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_02": "That smell! It's trying to claw down my throat like a thing alive!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_03": "Revolting! Smells like the aftermath of a halfling cheese-and-cabbage party.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_04": "Disgusting! Like a halfling burglar stuck up a dunnakin pipe 'til he's turned green and purple.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_01": "Won't be easy finding the Black Hook. Criminals don't tend to advertise their presence.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_02": "I've seen the inside of a bandit lair or two - against my will, if Lohner asks.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_03": "Stay alert, darlings. The Black Hook's lair will be well-hidden.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_04": "I worked for the Black Hook up in Marienburg, but I've no idea where their base is in Bögenhafen.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_a_01": "So there's sickness in Bögenhafen? We'll burn it out.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_a_02": "Plague, pestilence and followers of a mad god. Just another Aubentag for us, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_b_01": "What did Lohner call that gang he wants investigating? The Black Hook? I don't investigate, darlings. I immolate.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_b_02": "The Black Hook gang are part of this, or so Lohner said. Let's start there.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_c_01": "They'll tell us what we want to know. Fire has a way of coaxing forth the truth.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_c_02": "We'll have the truth. Then we'll have a lovely little bonfire.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_01": "I know this mark. It's the Steinhäger crest.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_02": "These provisions were for the Steinhäger family, not this dump.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_03": "Poor little Black Hooks - this poison was meant for the Steinhägers.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_04": "Stolen provisions, a mysterious outbreak. This makes horrible sense, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_01": "Oh, well done. No one will have heard that.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_02": "They'll have heard that clean to Altdorf. We'd better move.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_03": "I enjoyed that! It's likely having a bugle-blast announce our arrival!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_04": "Sorry? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_01": "Bit more civilised over there, isn't it darlings?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_02": "No shortage of coin south of the river.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_03": "Seems peaceful over there, doesn't it? Well, they do say ignorance is bliss.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_04": "Bögenhafen's charming enough, I suppose, but I wouldn't want to live here.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_01": "Whew! Now that's done, what say we take a look around?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_02": "Lots of bodies, but no answers. Let's fix that, shall we?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_03": "Take a look around, darlings. There'll be a clue somewhere.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_04": "Wonder what they were protecting. Let's find out.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_01": "Volans! How do folk live like this?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_02": "Wouldn't catch me living in a place like this, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_03": "I wouldn't keep a dog down here, let alone family.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_04": "There's desperation here, darlings. Born of powerlessness.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_01": "Disgusting! No one should live in a place like this.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_02": "The deeper we go, the worse it gets...",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_03": "I've seen worse poor quarters, but not many.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_04": "This isn't a home, darlings. It's a trap for those with nowhere else to go.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_01": "Well, well, well. These lads and lasses have been busy.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_02": "The Black Hook were always good at making shipments... disappear.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_03": "Huh. Looks like at least one warehouse is a good bit shorter on stock than its owner knows.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_04": "No shame in stealing, if it's done well. What? It's no different to Imperial taxes.",

	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_eleven_01": "Delighted, darling. Can we do it again?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_four_01": "There's more to life than money, Markus.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_nine_01": "Oh? Perhaps your lot should spend less time hassling poor old women, and more on bandits.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_seven_01": "Do you not have bandits amongst your kind, Kerillian?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_seven_02": "What a lovely sentiment.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_ten_01": "Feels good to be burning something, doesn't it Saltzpyre?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_ten_02": "You old dog. You'll make me blush.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_three_01": "Only in the Empire could a wealthy town have so many starving mouths.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_01": "I wouldn't eat that food, darlings. There's a taint about it.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_02": "Daemonic taint... From the food?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_03": "There's chaos magic in the air, darlings. The food is tainted.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_04": "The food. It's been cursed. That explains plenty.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_01": "All those warehouses... Please tell me we don't have to search them all.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_02": "So there is wealth in Bögenhafen. Pity it's not shared by all.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_03": "Ah, the fifty-eight warehouses of Bögenhafen. Even I've heard of them.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_04": "Hah! What kind of fool keeps his wares in a flammable warehouse?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_01": "Keep going! There must be a way through!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_02": "Better hope there's a way out at the other end!",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_03": "Trapped? No. There'll be a way through.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_04": "I do hope this isn't a dead end, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_01": "This isn't right, darlings. Why's it so quiet?",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_02": "Can't say I care for the quiet, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_03": "There's a time for quiet, but this isn't it. Eyes open, darlings.",

	"pbw_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_01": "Some supplies remain. Take what you can!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_02": "Nothing like a Shallyan storeroom if you're in need of medicine.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_03": "This looks like an apothecary's workroom.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_04": "Bandages, elixir. Must be an apothecary's haunt.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_01": "How many occupants of these cells were truly mad? How many merely spoke unwelcome truths?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_02": "Such cells are seldom empty. So many transgressions lead to a 'madman's' confinement.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_03": "Madness takes many forms. Sometimes the form of a jailor.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_04": "These cells... Madmen? Heretics? Poor souls who crossed a Witch Hunter?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_correct_switch_01": "The door's opened... and reveals another.",

	"pbw_level_catacombs_correct_switch_04": "That's more like it! But there's another.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_cultist_door_01": "Won't you look at that. Runes of the north...",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_cultist_door_02": "Northlander runes. Interesting.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_cultist_door_03": "Northlander runes, darlings. Like writing, but for folk of no intellect.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_cultist_door_04": "See that rune? Work of the Rotbloods, if I know my clumsy scrawl.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_healing_ward_01": "A sick-house without the sick? Where have they gone to?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_healing_ward_02": "Where are the sick? Where are the bodies?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_healing_ward_03": "No priests, no acolytes, no afflicted. I don't like this, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_healing_ward_04": "Deserted, but there was a struggle here, and no mistake.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_01": "Is that that chanting?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_02": "(laugh) I think we're near our goal! To me, flames!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_03": "Chaos sorcerers? I'm going to enjoy this!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_04": "Sorcerers? Time to pit fire against the dark. The fire always wins!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_01": "I don't like it, but that hole's our only path.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_02": "Down that way, darlings. I'll be right behind you.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_03": "Time to trust to our luck, darlings. Through the hole.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_04": "Into the bowels it is - and that's no figure of speech!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_01": "Bones and death. Well we're no strangers to that!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_02": "An old catacomb, by the look.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_03": "By the Eight! We've wandered in to a catacomb.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_04": "The deeper we go, the more death surrounds us!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_01": "Every drop, infested with daemonic life.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_02": "Don't mistake that fluid for water, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_03": "That's not water. Not in a place like this.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_04": "There's pestilence enough in that water to wipe out a city!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_01": "Their own power's consuming them! Fight on!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_02": "Sorcerer's dead, darlings. The ritual's feeding on them!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_03": "That's one sorcerer dead. Consumed by his own ritual.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_04": "See that? The ritual's consuming its creators.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_disrupted_ritual_01": "That was a close one, darlings, but it's done!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_disrupted_ritual_02": "Back to your dark master, Northlanders!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_disrupted_ritual_03": "Close one, darlings. Nearly had a daemon to fight.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_disrupted_ritual_04": "The ritual's power disperses. (deep breath) That was too close.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_exit_through_portal_01": "The Bridge opens, and not before time.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_exit_through_portal_02": "We're summoned home. I need a sleep, a drink and a bath. Not necessarily in that order.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_exit_through_portal_03": "Olesya's portal! Let's get out of this muck.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_ritual_exit_through_portal_04": "I've never been more glad to see the crone's bridge.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sabotage_ritual_01": "Ha! We're interfering with their ritual! It turns their dark magic against them!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sabotage_ritual_02": "All power, no discipline! We're disrupting the ritual just by being here!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sabotage_ritual_03": "(laugh) Their power's waning. We're slackening the ritual. Fight on!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sabotage_ritual_04": "Feel that? It's the ritual slipping. We're disrupting it!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_01": "Sewers... A woman could grow tired of darkness and filth.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_02": "Wading about in muck... Again.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_03": "What a stench! Thank the Eight the water level's low.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_04": "That stench! I'll taste that for days.",

	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_heavy_02": "Daemon-fronds! Fire guard me!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_heavy_03": "Have a care around those plants. They look hungry.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_heavy_04": "The filth grows thicker - see what sprouts from its bosom!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_01": "There's dark magic in this stinking breeze, and filth on the floor.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_02": "This filth is not of our world, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_03": "Proof, if needed, that we're in deep and stinking waters, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_sewers_nurglefication_light_04": "Something worse than ratties has claimed this territory...",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_shield_of_flies_01": "The flies protect them!",

	"pbw_level_catacombs_slime_trail_03": "Darlings? We might want to follow that slime trail.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_slime_trail_04": "That ooze marks a trail, darlings. Shall we follow?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_01": "Fire and ruin! They'll pay for this slaughter!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_02": "What vile purpose requires such sacrifice!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_03": "They seek to summon a daemon! Stop them, and quickly!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_spot_ritual_04": "They're calling on a daemon! I'll immolate them all!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_eight_01": "You have to admit, it's a practical suggestion.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_eleven_01": "This makes twisted sense. Nurgle and Shallya are natural enemies.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_eleven_02": "Kinder? Compassionate? Empathetic?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_five_01": "Not all afflictions end in heresy, Saltzpyre.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_five_02": "I'll bear that in mind.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_one_01": "Non-violence isn't a shield, Markus.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_one_02": "Don't worry. I've a feeling you'll have the opportunity to vent your anger before we're done.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_seven_01": "I've heard you mention Shallya before, Kerillian.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_seven_02": "What harm does it do to listen?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_ten_01": "I loathe followers of Nurgle.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_ten_02": "Oh, it's not the smell I mind.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_story_ten_03": "They're invariably so sodden with pus and festering fluid that the fires don't catch. Takes all the fun out of it.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_switch_instructions_01": "Quickly, darlings. Pick a switch.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_switch_instructions_02": "One of these switches must open the way.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_switch_instructions_03": "Find the switch that opens the door, or I'll burn us out!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_switch_instructions_04": "Which switch is it? Surely one of them must work?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_01": "Into the tunnel! My flames are hungry!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_02": "A tunnel. That's sure to be the way!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_03": "Come on, darlings! We've folk to avenge!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_04": "No secret how they got in. Look at that!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_two_sorcerer_dead_01": "Die, rotty! So much for your magic!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_two_sorcerer_dead_02": "Another's gone, darlings. Nearly there.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_two_sorcerer_dead_03": "That's another dead sorcerer! It's working.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_two_sorcerer_dead_04": "Just a little longer, darlings. Another sorcerer just breathed his last.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_way_is_clear_01": "Move up, darlings. Let's get out of this mist!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_way_is_clear_02": "Volans! I'll be glad to get out of this mist!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_way_is_clear_03": "What are you waiting for? The way is clear.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_way_is_clear_04": "Door's open, darlings. Let's go!",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_01": "Wrong switch, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_02": "Fire and ash! That wasn't right.",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_03": "Try another... Wait, did I hear something?",
	"pbw_level_catacombs_whoa_wrong_switch_04": "Not so simple is it, darlings? Try another.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_arena_01": "Northlanders have strange priorities. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was an arena.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_arena_02": "What do you suppose this place is?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_arena_03": "Why go to all this effort...? Oh, it's an arena.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_arena_04": "An arena, all the way out here? Why not build something useful?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_01": "We can use this ram to break our way in.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_02": "I can't burn that wall, so let's use this ram.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_03": "What a charming battering ram. I say we put it to use.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_04": "See that ram, darlings? Reckon we can find a use for it?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_use_01": "The ram's in place! Let's smash the gate!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_use_02": "Knock-knock, northlanders!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_use_03": "Shall we see if anyone's home, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_battering_ram_use_04": "Time for the battering ram to earn its keep, don't you think?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_cabin_01": "Plenty of hermits in the Empire - most of them avoiding men like Saltzpyre.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_cabin_02": "The isolated life's not for me. I like the wildness of cities.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_cabin_03": "What a squalid little hut.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_cabin_04": "I doubt that's the war camp. Wouldn't fit many northlanders in there.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_camp_view_01": "There it is! Hurry up, darlings. It's not like there's much to admire.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_camp_view_02": "I see the encampment! Not far to go!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_camp_view_03": "There's the encampment! Right in the middle of the marsh.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_camp_view_04": "That looks like what we're searching for!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_dead_champion_01": "Hah! That's how to deal with Northlander brutes! No superfluous banter, and definitely no quarter.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_dead_champion_02": "Yes, darlings! It took some convincing, but the Champion's finally left the Reikland.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_dead_champion_03": "Your god versus my flame. Wasn't really a contest.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_dead_champion_04": "And... he's dead. I thought he'd last longer.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_depart_01": "We stay here, they will kill us.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_depart_02": "Darlings? I think it's time for us to take a bow and dance away.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_depart_03": "Come, darlings. Time to leave.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_depart_04": "We've upset them. I think they mean to have short, violent words with us.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_01": "Not seeing this anarchy I was promised...",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_02": "Seems the northlanders aren't happy with the result.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_03": "The northlanders aren't happy, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_04": "Seems the fight's not done.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_01": "Plenty of hiding places up ahead.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_02": "So much timber, and none of it'll burn. Pity.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_03": "(laugh) Hiding amongst rotting timber, northlanders?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_04": "They'll be hiding in those shacks, you'll see.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_state_01": "A whole village in the mire. Takes all sorts.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_state_02": "This village reminds me of a large, dead spider, sinking into the mud.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_state_03": "Look at it, sinking away. Folk lived here, once upon a time.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_state_04": "Another couple of years, this whole village will have sunk into the mire.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_01": "Those islands won't keep them safe. One good rainstorm, and they'll be gone.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_02": "Imagine camping in the marsh. You'd wake up covered in frogs and snakes.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_03": "Looks like we've found the war camp's outer edge.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_04": "I'd torch the tents, but they're sodden.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_keep_fighting_01": "Burn! All of you! Burn! Send out your champion. I'll burn him too!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_keep_fighting_02": "Getting tired, darlings? We've still a champion to slay.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_keep_fighting_03": "Keep moving! Don't let them corner us! We have to find the champion.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_keep_fighting_04": "Had enough yet, northlanders? Maybe send out this champion of yours.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_live_in_swamp_01": "I couldn't live in a swamp. Nothing burns right.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_live_in_swamp_02": "Wouldn't catch me living in a swamp, darlings. The smell alone is enough!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_live_in_swamp_03": "Why are the Rotbloods so keen on swampland? I don't see the attraction, personally.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_live_in_swamp_04": "Maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe there'll be enough marsh gas to set ablaze.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_01": "Within the walls. We're making progress, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_02": "Is it me, or does this feel like a trap?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_03": "Walls in front and behind. We're good little flies in the spider's lair.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_04": "Another wall? That's hardly fair.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_portal_01": "(laugh) Now that was an adventure.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ravine_01": "Perhaps some fire to light our way? That always pleases.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ravine_02": "Eyes open, darlings. We have plenty of friends coming to play.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ravine_03": "They could be all around us!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_ravine_04": "We'll hear them before we see them. Be ready!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_four_01": "Ugh! Why do the Rotbloods love this swamp so?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_four_02": "Not all of us.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_nine_02": "You should try Tilea. One big swamp.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_nine_03": "All of it. The land, the people, the food. I've never bathed so much in my life. And still the stink of it lingered for weeks.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_one_01": "Nonsense. Some folk simply like to live alone.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_one_02": "Perhaps they deserved it.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_seven_01": "Oh, they're practised in rot and decay, I'll give you that. But they'll burn just the same.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_seven_02": "Oh, I warm everything, Markus... And then I set it on fire.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_story_twelve_02": "(laugh)",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_success_01": "With a bit of luck, that'll keep our hideout secret a while longer.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_success_02": "Fair's fair, darlings. That champion went looking for us, and he found us.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_success_03": "Lohner's secret base stays secret. Job's done.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_success_04": "That champion's well-cooked, and our work's done.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_01": "The air's tainted. This is a witch's tree, not a gallows.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_02": "A witch's tree. The northlanders were calling on something.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_03": "Bog-magic and human sacrifice. Unpleasant stuff, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_04": "The tree's the centre for a ritual, but I think it's incomplete.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_wall_01": "Given time, that gate will collapse all by itself. Thankfully, we've a faster method.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_wall_02": "The wall's in sight! One last effort!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_wall_03": "Aim for the gate! Not the wall!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_wall_04": "There's a charm of protection on those walls. Won't help them against us!",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_01": "Hello up there? Sentries? You're under attack (laugh)",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_02": "A watchtower? Looks like the camp's still expanding.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_03": "Careful. There could be more in that watchtower.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_04": "Why build a watchtower in a swamp? It'll only sink into the mud.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_which_way_01": "Choice of direction, darlings. Which do we prefer?",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_camp_which_way_02": "Which path? Make a good choice, darlings.",

	"pbw_level_chaos_war_surprise_01": "I don't know why they seem so surprised. We knocked and everything.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_surprise_02": "We're inside, darlings! Let's enjoy ourselves.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_surprise_03": "We're trapped in here with them. But that champion's also trapped here with us.",
	"pbw_level_chaos_war_surprise_04": "Surprise! I've a message from the farmers of Ussingen!",
	"pbw_level_crawl_intro_a_01": "Darlings... How did we get here? It's all a bit hazy...",
	"pbw_level_crawl_intro_a_02": "A quiet drink, darlings. That's what you said. But that was hours ago.",
	"pbw_level_crawl_intro_b_01": "I don't remember drinking all the ale, but it's all gone.",
	"pbw_level_crawl_intro_b_02": "We're out of ale, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_crawl_intro_c_01": "Maybe one last drinky before we call it a night?",

	"pbw_level_dlc_bogenhafen_story_three_01": "To think we reckoned this began in the slums. Goes to show, Lohner doesn't always know everything.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_01": "Magnificent! Look at that brute of a tree!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_02": "Seeing a tree like that, I can understand why you'd be tempted to bend the knee.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_03": "One huge tree, all alone? Must've been special or stubborn.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_04": "All alone, but unbowed? I know how you feel, tree.",

	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_broken_waystone_03": "Such waystones dissipate and guide the Eight Winds. A broken one doesn't bode well.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_broken_waystone_04": "A broken waystone is never a good sign, darlings. Tread with care.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_clearing_01": "Such beauty. If only I could have seen its unfaded glory.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_clearing_02": "I must admit, the elves have a knack for crafting beauty.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_clearing_03": "See how the stone is shaped to complement the natural world? Not like our towns. We stamp things flat, and build over the top.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_clearing_04": "Reminds me of Bretonnia, but without the graffiti and preening aristocrats.",

	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_cliff_edge_04": "A delightful view, but we should press on.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_01": "Wish I could've seen this place when it was whole, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_02": "Still got a bit of splendour about it. Wish we had time to explore.",

	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_exit_03": "Please tell me we've a way out... Try that passageway.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_exit_04": "We should leave, darlings. Last one into that passageway... Well, you're probably dead.",

	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_first_aligned_pleasant_feeling_03": "Oh, what a sensation. Hot and cold, all at once.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_first_aligned_pleasant_feeling_04": "Ashes and ruin! Now that's a good feeling.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_01": "These trees! So majestic.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_02": "A shame fouling this place with tainted blood.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_03": "What tales could these trees tell if they could speak?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_04": "There's foulness lurking beneath these trees. We'll burn it out!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_01": "The undergrowth bars our way! We'll have to hack a path through!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_02": "This is not natural growth, it hides the path. We need to cut our way through.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_03": "Our route lies through that twisted grove. We'll have to clear a path.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_maze_approach_04": "A maze of branches. No time to solve its puzzles. We'll have to clear our own route!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_maze_interior_01": "I think I'm lost! Which way is it?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_maze_interior_02": "Which way now? Answer, or I start burning trees!",

	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_02": "(laugh) Noisy old beast, isn't it?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_03": "(laugh) That racket's bound to bring us some playmates.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_04": "It's working! Keep going, but watch for enemies.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_proper_01": "Keep going, darlings. Nearly there!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_proper_02": "We'll not get another chance at this. Clear a path!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_proper_03": "If only I'd more time to study the ruins. Do a little digging...",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_proper_04": "What secrets do these ruins hold? Oh well, another time, perhaps.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_01": "This could be an ambush.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_02": "Have a care, darlings. Watch for enemies amongst the rocks.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_03": "Take heed, ravines are perfect killing grounds. Filled my share with smouldering remains through the years.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_ravine_approach_04": "Feet wet, darlings. The river'll not hurt us.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_01": "Worth a little noise, eh darlings? We're nearly done.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_02": "The Eight are calming. Just a little more to do.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_03": "One last alignment, then we're out of here.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_04": "One crystal left. Let's get this over with.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_01": "It seems clear enough to me - this device needs realigning.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_02": "I suspect realigning this device will soothe the storm.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_03": "This device bleeds power from the leylines. If realigned, it'll calm the skies.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_04": "And now we see the cause. Someone's knocked that device out of whack.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_01": "I'm no expert, but I think those crystals are the key.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_02": "I think... Yes, try manipulating those crystals.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_03": "If I recall correctly... Try activating a crystal.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_04": "It's a simple enough concept. Give one of the crystals a nudge.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_01": "The temple's been torn apart! Think of what you could do with such power!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_02": "Don't be alarmed, darlings. We're just walking into a magical riptide. Nothing to worry about... I think.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_03": "You know, I've a suspicion all's not right with this temple...",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_04": "Look at that. Let's hope it stays up there 'til we're out from under it.",

	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_02": "Seems like the Skaven are here in force. How many more wait ahead?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_03": "Gormanns gut! Glad we're here. Had the ratties more time they'd have dug a Nest!",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_04": "(laugh) Oh, ratties. Just because you put a flag on it, doesn't mean it's yours.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_eight_01": "I've never understood the rift between elves and dwarfs.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_eight_02": "...naturally...",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_eight_03": "(snort) Hah! You don't ask for much, do you?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_five_01": "I'll do nothing to that tree, Bardin. Besides, who'd come to help us?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_seven_01": "I wish Kerillian were with us. Her insight might have been useful.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_seven_02": "I know that tone. What did she do, Markus?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_ten_01": "I don't like the look of this. Wild magic's a dangerous proposition.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_ten_02": "Couldn't agree more... And how do we do that, exactly?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_twelve_02": "You need to open your eyes, Markus. Many feet walked these forests before our kind. Just as many will after.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_twelve_03": "There's always something 'after'. We may not live to see it, but life will continue.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_two_01": "Can you tell us anything of this place, Kerillian?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_story_two_02": "Then these are not the work of your people?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_01": "I don't suppose we can stay and take a look around? No? You're simply no fun.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_02": "The Eight are calmed. We've done well.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_03": "We've restored the temple's purpose. Time to leave.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_04": "See? With the Eight calmed, Olesya has opened the Bridge.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_untouched_01": "Look around! The whole world must've been like this, once.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_untouched_02": "So refreshing to walk in a place untouched by industry.",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_untouched_03": "Ah, it's good to be away from civilisation. The air is different here, do you feel it?",
	"pbw_level_elven_ruins_untouched_04": "I'll have to be careful with my flames. Be a shame to set this dell alight.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_cart_01": "Shove that cart aside, darlings. We need to press on.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_cart_02": "Cart's blocking our way. Put your shoulder to it.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_cart_03": "Get that cart out of our way, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_cart_04": "Shove that cart out of the way, and we'll move on.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_deserted_01": "We're too late. These bastards will pay for this!",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_deserted_02": "More slain. Curse the Northlanders.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_deserted_03": "Nothing still alive that I don't long to set alight!",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_deserted_04": "Darlings, this isn't a farm any longer, it's a cemetery.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_end_level_01": "Ha! We've snatched a few from the pact-sworns' clutches!",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_end_level_02": "We've saved a few. It'll have to do, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_end_level_03": "No one left? Still, we've snatched a few sparks from the blaze.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_end_level_04": "That's the last cage. Fine work, darlings.",

	"pbw_level_farmlands_fence_03": "Don't tell me you can't climb that precious little fence?",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_fence_04": "Can't you climb the fence, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_01": "Is that Knopfelspiel's farm?",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_02": "First farm. Doesn't look good.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_03": "First farm, looks empty.",

	"pbw_level_farmlands_last_farm_03": "Where are the Empire's armies? Who defends the weak?",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_last_farm_04": "I tire of losing folk to these heinous butchers.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_locked_gate_01": "(snarl) The gate's locked, and it'll take too long to burn. Look for a key!",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_locked_gate_02": "Locked! Find the key! Hurry!",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_locked_gate_03": "Darlings! We need the key.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_locked_gate_04": "No way in through that gate without the key!",

	"pbw_level_farmlands_monster_in_barn_04": "There's something angry in the barn. Good. I'm angry too.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_move_on_01": "We failed this place. We shan't fail the next.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_move_on_02": "Morgensloft needs aid. There's no sense wasting time on the dead.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_move_on_03": "Calm yourself, Sienna. Let's just move on.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_move_on_04": "I'll burn the Northlanders by the score for this!",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_next_farm_01": "Lot of corpses, and not much else.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_next_farm_02": "No one to save, and the road leads on.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_next_farm_03": "Darlings, hurry along. We might not have much time.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_next_farm_04": "No harvest this year but blood and bone.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_no_prisoners_01": "Prisoners? Not a one. Just corpses.",

	"pbw_level_farmlands_portal_03": "Keep going, darlings. Into the portal.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_portal_04": "Into the portal. We'll be back soon enough. Depend upon it.",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_prisoners_01": "Set the captives loose, darlings. Kill anyone who tries to stop you!",

	"pbw_level_farmlands_story_ten_03": "But surely there's more to it?",
	"pbw_level_farmlands_story_three_01": "These farmers pay their taxes - where are the Empire's armies?",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_01": "There it is. Horrible, isn't it?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_02": "And that's our daemon-tree. Ugly thing.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_03": "There's the daemon-tree. Turns your stomach, doesn't it.",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_04": "It'll take more than flames and foul language to kill this.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_01": "What about black powder?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_02": "It looks hungry. Let's feed it explosives.",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_one_01": "You know, after all this time I've still no idea how these lifting platforms work.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_one_02": "...or slaves?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_six_01": "Don't know what the fuss is about this sorcerer. Swamp-water for brains, all of them.",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_six_02": "Oh, I'll manage something... artistic... never fear.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_six_x": "Not exactly, darling. But I am curious. To see if it burns.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_ten_01": "Does Helmgart's corruption really matter to you, Kerillian? It's just one mayfly town, after all.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_ten_02": "Then why does this Weave of yours not defend itself?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_three_01": "Perhaps the good folk of Helmgart should've built on the plains. No need for lifting platforms, then.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_three_02": "Well you can't do much defending if you're out of puff from marching up and down hills.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_the_hole_01": "Volans! I almost envy the pact-sworn for what they've done here.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_the_hole_02": "So much destruction. I am both awed and horrified at what they've done.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_the_hole_03": "So much destruction! Evil little beasts.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_the_hole_04": "It's not the ruin I can see that bothers me, darlings, but the dead I can't.",

	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04": "Fancy that. We've found ourselves a door.",

	"pbw_level_nurgle_outcast_lair_02": "Brigands are long gone too. Wonder if they had the sense to get out in time?",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_outcast_lair_03": "No tears for the occupants of this place, darlings. Bandits and cutpurses all.",

	"pbw_level_nurgle_ruins_03": "There's no sanctuary here, and likely nothing but Rotbloods and ratties.",

	"pbw_level_nurgle_skaven_collapse_02": "Worked to death, by the looks of it. Can't say I care.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_skaven_collapse_03": "Dead rats, and I didn't touch a one. Seems like a waste.",

	"pbw_level_nurgle_swift_river_01": "That river's in a hurry, but then so are we.",

	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_dead_warlord_03": "That should set rebellion galloping.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_dead_warlord_04": "He's dead, but have we done enough to foment disorder?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_01": "You know, this'd be even better if we ripped that banner down.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_02": "See that banner, darlings? Let's pull it down.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_03": "A downed banner sends a message. I like sending unpleasant messages to the ratties.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_04": "That banner... What say we tear it down. It'll be fun. I like fun.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_01": "So many... Lohner was right. We need to set them upon each other.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_02": "Look at that! Industrious little vermin, aren't they?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_03": "Tightly packed nest this. Can't wait to see them tear themselves apart.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_04": "No such thing as Skaven, they said. They're a myth, they said. Well they should see this city.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_01": "The platform's faster than walking.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_02": "The moving platform? Well, we've walked far enough.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_03": "The platform should give us a swift exit - if it works.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_04": "Shall we ride the rest of the way?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_exit_01": "So, where's the portal?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_exit_02": "Olesya better be waiting. It's a long walk back.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_exit_03": "Now, where's the Bridge?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_exit_04": "That was enjoyable, but all things must end.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_01": "No way through, darlings. We need another way to the forge.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_02": "Can't get through here. We'll have to find the forge some other way.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_01": "Stick to the tracks, darlings. They should lead to the forge.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_02": "We're supposed to follow these tracks, right?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_01": "Was this a forge? Hard to even tell now the ratties have had their way.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_02": "By Volans, this forge... look what the ratties have done...",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_03": "Shame to see so much fire shackled. Worse still to see the place in ruins.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_04": "A chamber dedicated to fire, now a flooded ruin.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_01": "Hear that racket? Sounds like rat ogres.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_02": "Are those rat ogres I hear?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_03": "Ah, the dull roar of a rat ogre. No, several rat ogres.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_04": "Those rat ogres do not sound happy, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_lifting_device_moved_01": "Oooh, nice! Flames for all, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_lifting_device_moved_02": "Hah, bit of lovely flame there! Nice!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_01": "Impressive. I'll not hold a spark when I'm as old as these machines.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_02": "Dwarfs build to last, don't they?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_03": "Mark my words, these mechanisms'll still be working when the Empire's ashes.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_04": "(slow whistle) These dwarfs. Clever doesn't begin to cover it.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_long_way_down_01": "Take in the view if you'd like, but watch your footing.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_long_way_down_02": "Fall down there, darlings, and I'll not see you again.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_long_way_down_03": "Nice view. But it comes with a long drop.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_long_way_down_04": "That's a long drop. Careful where you tread.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_01": "No sense staying. Which way's out?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_02": "I'd rather not be caught up in a ratty civil war, if it's all the same to you.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_03": "The ratties will dance to our tune quite merrily without us, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_04": "Time for us to go. Unless you want quarrelling Skaven battling for your corpses?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_01": "We should clear the way, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_02": "That lifting-thing's obstructing our path, darlings",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_01": "Discretion, darlings. Too many patrols about.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_02": "Let's take the easy path. Stay clear of the patrols.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_03": "There'll be patrols up ahead.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_04": "Keep an eye out for patrols.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_rat_ogre_rampage_01": "(laugh) Look at it go.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_rat_ogre_rampage_02": "(laugh) Oh, what a beautiful sight!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_rat_ogre_rampage_03": "(laugh) Like poetry in mangy motion.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_rat_ogre_rampage_04": "(laugh) Go on! Kill them all, you brute!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_release_rat_ogre_01": "Shame to see that rat ogre in a cage.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_release_rat_ogre_02": "We could set that rat ogre free. It only looks like it wants to... play... with the other Skaven.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_release_rat_ogre_03": "Oh, you poor darling. Did someone lock you up? Gives me an idea, that.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_release_rat_ogre_04": "You know, I've a powerful urge to open that cage over there. Could be fun.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_01": "Well, this stealthy approach lasted as long as I suspected. Good riddance! (maniacal laugh)",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_02": "Didn't Lohner say something about stealth? Oh well, he's not here, is he?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eight_01": "Is that doubt I hear doubt in Saltzpyre's voice? Mister Black-and-White discovers grey?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eleven_01": "Ratties'll have looted it long ago. Besides, Bardin wouldn't let you keep it.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_nine_01": "(laugh) As suspected, not much sneaking, but lots of lovely rat-burning!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_nine_02": "So much better this way. Just listen to the crackle and snap of burning fur.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_nine_03": "Shut your trap, Saltzpyre, or I'll torch that precious hat-collection of yours.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_one_01": "You really think they'll believe that?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_six_01": "Do you know much about the Skaven clans, Bardin?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_six_02": "Of course... So your hold never had Skaven trouble.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_six_03": "(laugh) True enough.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_ten_01": "Have you any hopes of reclaiming this hold, Bardin?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_ten_02": "Shouldn't give up hope, darling. Things might change for the better.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_ten_03": "And if she's wrong?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_twelve_01": "If Lohner finds an opportunity, I bet we'll be off doing just that.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_twelve_02": "Same here. His network was impressive even before Olesya's new powers. We'd be blind without them.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_story_victor_two_01": "Seems like you settled an old score with the Warlord, Saltzpyre?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_01": "We've been well paid to see you dead, vermin!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_02": "Betrayed by your own kind? That has to sting! Let me burn away the pain.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_03": "Your own kind want you dead, ratty!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_04": "Betrayed from within, and now the no-fur assassins come to take your head!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_viaduct_01": "Ah, that's the viaduct right there, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_viaduct_02": "Head for the viaduct, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_01": "Just look at this. Gets more wondrous the further you look.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_02": "We've seen an astonishing view or two in our travels, haven't we, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_03": "Ignoring the fact it's teeming with Skaven - this is quite the view.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_04": "Another view to remember, darlings. Make sure you make it out alive.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_01": "Time to burn a warlord!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_02": "Just the warlord to go, darlings. Are we ready?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_03": "The foundry was the overture, the rat ogre the aria. The warlord's death shall be the finale!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_04": "To me, my flames. We've a warlord to incinerate!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_01": "Over there, darlings! That's the warlord's nest.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_02": "The warlord'll be up there, just you see.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_03": "See that nest? Bound to be the warlord's.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_04": "The warlord's nest, you think? Looks grand, by their standards.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_01": "There we go!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_02": "That cleared the way!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_03": "We just found a way through, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_04": "Can we realign the waterwheels, perhaps?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_01": "Can we realign the waterwheels, perhaps?",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_02": "Maybe move those waterwheels? Worth a try, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_03": "Moving the waterwheel into position might work.",
	"pbw_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_04": "Aligning the waterwheels seems to be the only way forward.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_01": "Aha! This must rouse the skittergate. Who will do the honours?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_01a": "Here we are. Pop the Keystaff in place, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_02": "I suppose that's the lever we want. If we can't open the gate, our trip ends here.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_02a": "Yes? What are you waiting for? Use the Keystaff, and we'll know if we're stuck here forever or not.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_03": "We'll have to rouse the gate, darlings. Give that lever a tug.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_03a": "Pray to your gods once again, darlings. The Keystaff better work.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_04": "Don't be shy, darlings. Pull the lever. What's the worst that could happen?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_activate_gate_04a": "Keystaff. Control panel. Couldn't be much easier.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_arrive_01": "Woah! All in one piece. Bodes well, don't you think, darlings?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_arrive_02": "All arms and legs accounted for, darlings? Marvellous!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_arrive_03": "I must say, that went rather well! Please don't remind me we'll have to do it again, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_arrive_04": "That wasn't so bad after all, darlings. Better than letting a hedge-wizard practice casting Earthblood on you...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_01": "Well... wow.. we're back. And ourselves. I hope.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_02": "Well, ugh, it's dark and green, not bright and white. I'd say we're back, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_03": "Ouff, Alive.. and back in the gloom, for better or worse.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_04": "Ugh! Not kind to flesh and bone that, but hey, we... made it?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_response_01": "Ouff! Volans vicissitude!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_response_02": "Ugh... never, ever again...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_response_03": "Urrgh.. no way for a woman to travel...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_back_home_response_04": "Ugh... Feeling a little discombobulated darlings...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_BOOM_01": "And no more skittergate! Oh, we just keep on winning, don't we darlings?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_BOOM_02": "We've done it, darlings! We came, we fought, we melted faces, and we did it with style!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_BOOM_03": "Skittergate? What skittergate? Hah!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_BOOM_04": "The horrid gate dies with its master, darlings! I like it when they die.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_01": "We're getting close. I expected a crowd, but killing that Warlord made a difference, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_02": "Now, where are our playmates? I'd love to say I've incinerated them all, but killing the Warlord is a more probable cause.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_03": "Seem to be lacking in guards. So our efforts have paid off. Especially the Warlord killing.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_04": "We got this far too easily. Either a surprise is waiting, or the Warlord's death worked wonders.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_contol_panel_01": "Well, that's the control panel, darlings. We'll be back here soon enough.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_contol_panel_02": "There - that's the control, just waiting for the key.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_contol_panel_03": "We'll be back here soon enough, darlings. Assuming we can find the Keystaff.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_contol_panel_04": "That control panel's worthless without the key. Let's work on that, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crater_01": "Such a mind-numbing dreadful mess they've made. I wish someday we could reach their cities, and do the same.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crater_02": "I know when I'm outmatched. No way could I cause this much destruction. Well, not yet.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crater_03": "When the skaven set their minds to something, they're... terrifyingly formidable.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crater_04": "Helmgart's seen better days, darlings. By Volans, everything has...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crates_01": "Reckon we'll find more warpstone amongst those crates?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crates_02": "They're bringing something ashore at the docks. Might be warpstone.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crates_03": "They're bringing something in over the seas. Maybe it's warpstone?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_crates_04": "What about those crates? Worth checking for warpstone?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_dead_seer_01": "Oh, by the Eight Winds and the ninth from the arse! Rat-mage explosion! Best thing I've ever seen, not involving flames as high as Magnus's Tower!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_dead_seer_02": "Oh, For the love of flame, I hope you all saw that! The Grey Seer gone for good! His entrails makes a fine mural on these cavern walls, don't you think?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_dead_seer_03": "Oh, darlings, finally! The rat-bastard's not coming back from that! And how he went! I'll think of that blood-splosion whenever I'm down from now on.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_dead_seer_04": "Woow! THAT was worth every painful wound, every sickening stench and every second of mind-killing boredom at the keep I've had to suffer. We did it, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_destroy_01": "I hate to say this, but I don't think we can destroy it from this side.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_destroy_02": "I'm at a loss, darlings. The delicate bits must be on the other side.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_destroy_03": "Destroying the skittergate doesn't look so easy now, does it?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_destroy_04": "Volans! I can't see an obvious weakness.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_docks_gate_01": "Here we are, darlings. Now let's make a memorable entrance!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_docks_gate_02": "At last. A long walk to avoid an unwanted fight, darlings. Time to seek the one we want!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_docks_gate_03": "Let's get inside, darlings! Even back doors aren't always so welcoming.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_docks_gate_04": "Hurry up, darlings! Let's not lose the element of surprise!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_elevator_01": "Lifting platform, darlings. Why climb or walk anywhere, if there's no need?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_elevator_02": "We'll use the lifting platform, darlings. We'll need our strength soon enough.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_elevator_03": "Keep to the lifting platform, at least for now.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_elevator_04": "That lifting platform's going down, and so are we.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_encampment_01": "Look at that! A whole encampment of northlanders, just waiting for a flame.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_encampment_02": "This is important: don't be greedy - save a few northlanders for me.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_encampment_03": "We'll have to fight our way through that encampment.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_encampment_04": "That encampment might be trouble. Or it might be kindling.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_enter_gate_01": "Lohner better tell people I died in battle and not by doing something as completely asinine as this.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_enter_gate_02": "Right. Let's hope our innards stay where they should, eh darlings?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_enter_gate_03": "Cheer up, darlings. Maybe we'll find an alternate universe, with no skaven, northlanders or Saltzpyre?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_enter_gate_04": "This will work out fine darlings. For us.. or the Pact-sworn.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_fire_gatekeeper_transform_01": "Feuerbach's codpiece! You saw that, darlings? That's what the dark gods do to you.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_fire_gatekeeper_transform_02": "By the Key! That's something you don't see everyday, darlings. But I digress, we have a new-born spawn to kill, after all.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_follow_01": "After him! We'll have to cross the threshold!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_follow_02": "Into the skittergate! We'll look for a solution beyond.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_follow_03": "Through the skittergate, my darlings!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_follow_04": "Follow the seer! We'll try this from the other side.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_01": "Could be worse. I half-expected the shore to be thick with ships.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_02": "Plenty more ships to come, darlings. And plenty more northlanders with them.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_03": "Only a couple of ships. More will come as word of the skittergate spreads.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_04": "If only I had time to burn those ships.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_01": "Oh, I've scorched plenty like you, gatekeeper! Chop you into pieces, and my friends can use your bones as torches!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_02": "Nothing to worry us here, darlings. Just another flammable wind-bag. Let's make it quick and painful.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_03": "They're always haughty and brave to start with, darlings. Then their armour burns hot enough to melt their skin.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_04": "I'll give you a hint, Rot-head. When I set you on fire, rolling in the snow may help, but remember, we have no gentlemen rules against finishing you on the ground.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_01": "Didn't make much difference after all, did it? Dead is dead, spawn or not. Grab the Keystaff, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_02": "There! Out of its misery. So now... yes, please fetch the Keystaff, darlings. I'd like to get out of here too.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gate_activated_01": "Oh yes, that did the trick. Now for the suicidal part - going through a rat-gate.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gate_activated_02": "Wakey-wakey skittergatey. Four fools are about to dare you.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gate_activated_03": "See? That's exactly what we needed. Into the gate darlings, we might just not disintegrate!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_gate_activated_04": "Well? It's clearly activated so don't just stand there. Let's do this impossibly stupid thing.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_01": "Back to the controls, darlings. We're not finished yet.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_02": "So far, Lohnesya's plan has worked perfectly. Let's keep to it and head for the gate controls, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_03": "We have the key. Now - which way back to the controls?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_04": "If only he'd kept the key closer to the control panel... oh well.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_01": "Sunburst and salamanders! It worked! Now, get down and smash those warp regulators.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_02": "Darlings? Remember what Lohner said about smashing warp regulators once the gate is up again? They're below us.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_03": "Those are warp regulators down below. Smash those, and the skittergate's done for.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_get_down_to_the_cooling_04": "Ratty technology below. Looks like warp regulators to keep the gate's energy in check.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_leave_01": "Now we just have to get out of here, darlings. With haste.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_leave_02": "Time to move, darlings. We can't die from falling rocks after all this. I won't allow it.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_leave_03": "The whole place is coming down. Back to the surface, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_leave_04": "Hurry up, darlings, it's all collapsing, and remember, if we die down here, Lohner takes all the credit.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_01": "We need that gate open.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_02": "One of you get the gate, would you darlings?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_03": "A gate bars our path.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_open_the_gate_04": "Get that gate open!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_01": "Don't target the Seer! Aim for the Stormfiend!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_02": "Remember the Seer's shield? He still has it, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_03": "Concentrate your efforts on the Stormfiend!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_04": "He's hiding behind his magic! Focus on his mount!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_05": "Don't waste your efforts on the Seer when his shield is up! Soften up the Stormfiend!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_06": "Fight the Stormfiend, not Rasknitt! When his shield drops, I'm melting eyeballs!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_07": "The seer's shield is up! Go for the monstrous and juicy target instead.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_08": "Let the Stormfiend have it! Ignore the shielded Skaven-cur riding it",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_09": "That Stormfiend is a bit too much of everything to be allowed to live, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_death_rattler_invulnerable_10": "The Stormfiend, darlings. Show the brute how much we love it.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_01": "Yes! The Seer's open for attack! Go get him! Get him good!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_02": "Seer's not in the saddle, darlings. Make the most of it!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_03": "Down went Rasknitt, foulest of the foul! Make him pay for everything, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_04": "The Seer's unprotected! Shoot him in the snout! Cut his whiskers!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_05": "Shield is down, darlings. The Seer's ripe for plucking. One stab for every death he's caused.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_06": "Opportunity, darlings! Seer's got no shield!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_07": "Seer's defence dropped, darlings! Who's with me ganging up on him?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_dismounted_one_08": "No shield on the Seer! We all want payback, darlings! This is the time!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_big_incoming_01": "Hm, do you hear anything?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_big_incoming_02": "Sound? What sound?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_reply_01": "A little late to the festivities, aren't we, Seer? We took the liberty of setting off the fireworks, before you deigned to show your flea-furred face. I'm afraid it's all over. For you.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_reply_02": "Hah! Swooping in to save the day for your dysfunctional pact, Seer? A brain short, and a lifetime late, you dirty, dirty rat.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_01": "Watch out for the Seer's spellcasting! Keep hitting him, and then hit him again!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_02": "Darlings, target the Seer to shake up his spell casting!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_03": "Focus on the Seer, darlings. For many, many reasons.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_04": "Darlings, I like it better when our Seer's reeling in pain than when he's flinging his foul magic around!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_01": "But I like interfering!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_02": "I haven't started interfering, ratty! That other stuff was only a warm up!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_03": "Make me!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_04": "Only when one of us is dead, ratty!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_01": "We don't give up easily, ratty!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_02": "Or maybe we're toying with you. Ever think of that?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_03": "You're not very convincing, ratty.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_04": "Keep telling yourself that, ratty!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_stormfiend_dead_01": "Volans' Mistress, that thing could take a beating! Dead now though!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_stormfiend_dead_02": "Hah! How's your pet doing, scab-faced mange-beast?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_01": "Oh no, no, darlings! Don't even think about letting him get away!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_02": "Oh, that sickening, teleporting rat-seer. I want him dead so very , very much.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_03": "Move, darlings! We all want payback, but we won't get it if we don't keep up!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_04": "Grey Seer Rasknitt! Stay and fight!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_replace_power_01": "Quickly now, let's power up the gate.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_replace_power_02": "Time to power up the gate.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_replace_power_03": "Let's hope we know enough about ratty machines for this to work.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_replace_power_04": "Let's warm the skittergate back up.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_01": "That's it! Now we just have to RUN LIKE DRAGONFLAME TO THE GATE!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_02": "Now! To the gate! Last one in is a soggy sock!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_03": "Darlings! Run! Into the gate! Go!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_04": "Remember, If we die down here, Lohner takes all the credit! Run! To the gate! Go!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_01": "Disable the warp regulators. Things'll get warm. Very warm.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_02": "Smash the warp regulators. It will overheat the skittergate.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_03": "Follow Olesya's recipe, smash the warp regulators!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_04": "Let's make things a bit warmer, shall we? Destroy the warp regulators!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_01": "So, darlings, where's this gatekeeper? I'm eager to introduce myself. My name for today is 'Boiling Eyes Berta'.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_02": "Gatekeeper? Reveal yourself. You have a gate to keep, you gormless lickspittle.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_03": "Come out and play, gatekeeper. This'll only take a brief, burning moment...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_04": "This pillock of a Gatekeeper better show himself, or the docks might suffer a firestorm...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_ships_01": "Could be worse. I expected a shore thick with ships.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_ships_02": "Plenty more ships to come, darlings. And plenty more northlanders with them.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_ships_03": "As word of the skittergate spreads more ships will come.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_ships_04": "If only I had time to burn those ships. They only exist to spread ruin and death.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_01": "We found it, darlings. The source of our troubles.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_02": "Ah. The gate's up ahead, just like Lohner said.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_03": "That's the skittergate... but you don't need me telling you that, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_04": "There it is. Horrible thing.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_01": "That must be our backdoor, darlings. Lovely.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_02": "Docks ahead, and from what I gather, the back door.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_03": "Docks coming up. And the back door entrance we seek, I hope.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_04": "See. Down there. That should be our way in.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_01": "No getting back without the gate. And apparently we'll need to snatch the Gatekeeper's Keystaff for that.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_02": "So we're off to find the gatekeeper, darlings? We do need his Keystaff if we're to get back.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_03": "Gate's dark and silent. We need the Keystaff. Time to find the Gatekeeper.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_04": "No way back without the gate, so just stick to Lohner's plan. Find the Gatekeeper.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_eight_01": "It's a bit... bleak, isn't it? I'd go reaving if I had to live in all this snow.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_eight_02": "Fire hates the cold. So do I. Is it really a surprise?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_eleven_01": "You know, Markus, I think that's what they have in mind.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_eleven_02": "That's the flame for you. At once a comfort and a pain.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_nine_01": "Are there dwarf holds so far north, Bardin?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_nine_02": "And you've not reclaimed them?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_seven_01": "You look troubled, Saltzpyre. Have done ever since we reached Norsca.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_seven_02": "We'll put an end to it.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_seven_03": "The Empire will stand, or it won't. We're only responsible for what we do, not what others do.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_six_01": "I did, cowardly little ratty.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_story_six_02": "Don't know why you'd want it, but I'll be happy to oblige. Mind you, it'll be scorched.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_01": "Agh! Not everyday one make suicidal choices twice!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_02": "Winds protect me from myself!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_03": "Any last words, darlings? Well here's mine: Flaming Bollocks!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_04": "Well at least this is as stupid as it gets, in case we survive...",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_01": "Close call, darlings, but that collapse is welcome. And so is our portal.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_02": "That's a lot of rock, darlings. Now we only need our portal.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_03": "You know, I think it's over - if we can avoid this final drizzle of rocks.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_04": "Hah! Even Helmgart wants a piece of the action!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vacated_area_01": "No seer, as expected. Lohnesya was right again. You get it? Lohner and Olesya? Lohnesya? Oh well.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vacated_area_02": "I expected more resistance, even with the ratty seer defiling the world somewhere else.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vacated_area_03": "Quite deserted and no sign of Rasknitt. Both good and bad, right darlings?",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vacated_area_04": "We're off to a good start, intelligence wise. As they said, no Rasknitt, no hordes.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vast_camp_01": "More northlanders? There are always more.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vast_camp_02": "So many tents... We can't let them reach the Reikland.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vast_camp_03": "Too many down there, even for us. Keep going.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vast_camp_04": "Not much left of the Reikland, darlings, if that lot get through.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vista_01": "That's one disturbingly huge encampment. Far too many northlanders to burn head-on.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vista_02": "There's no sense charging that beast of an encampment, darlings. Use the path Olesya discovered.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vista_03": "We'll never fight our way through that encampment, darlings. Thank Volans for Olesya's back door path.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_vista_04": "That encampment means trouble the size of a mountain range. Stick with the plan and use Olesya's path.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_01": "Frozen Norsca and a Bright Wizard. A match made in Nurgle's cauldron... or a Bretonnian midden.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_02": "Norsca. The sooner we're out of this frigid nightmare, the better.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_03": "Norsca. Even ice shivers up here. I regret coming already.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_04": "And now I'm in Norsca... another corner of the world visited against my will.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_01": "Come on, darlings. We don't want to lose it now!",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_02": "Back to the gate, but let's try to keep the winch-way in sight.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_03": "We'll follow the winch-way back.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_04": "It's off. And so should we be.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winch_01": "This winch-way serves the skittergate. It'll save us lugging the warpstone back.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winch_02": "Let's make use of that winch.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winch_03": "That's our warpstone. The winch-way should send it to the gate.",
	"pbw_level_skittergate_winch_04": "The winch-way can ferry our warpstone. Look for the lever.",
	"pbw_level_ussingen_at_last_end_01": "A good blow struck, but I'll be glad to be out of here.",
	"pbw_level_ussingen_at_last_end_02": "The portal's waiting for us.",
	"pbw_level_ussingen_at_last_end_03": "Into the portal, while we still can!",
	"pbw_level_ussingen_at_last_end_04": "Olesya's come through for us again. I could kiss that crone!",

	"pbw_portals_intro_line_c_01": "If we're trespassing Drachenfels, Lohner said something about a map.",

	"pbw_portals_kidnapped_traces_01": "Captives, perhaps? Taken to Drachenfels.",
	"pbw_portals_kidnapped_traces_02": "See that, darlings? Looks like some of them might still be alive in Drachenfels.",

	"pbw_portals_objective_recap_03": "Trust the map if you like, darlings. I prefer instinct.",
	"pbw_portals_objective_recap_04": "We'll just have to look on the map, and its squiggles, as bonus information, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_gate_01": "I suppose that gate might be marked on the map. Is there another route?",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_gate_02": "That mark could be the gate, or it might be a doodle. There must be another path.",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_gate_03": "Is this the gate marked on the map? Is there a way around?",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_gate_04": "We can't get through that gate. Look for a way around.",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_road_01": "Time to put that map to use, if we must.",

	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_vista_01": "You know, some people think that castle looks majestic. Just looks gloomy to me.",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_vista_02": "So many stories about that place. Hopefully, the worst aren't true.",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_vista_03": "Was Constant Drachenfels even real? People keep saying not, but that might be wishful thinking.",
	"pbw_portals_pbw_castle_vista_04": "Who'd live in a place like that? No one sane... Not that I've room to talk.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_event_01": "Did we want a working portal?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_event_02": "What did we do that for, darlings?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_event_03": "Oh, well done. I think.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_event_04": "What makes you think we wanted a working portal?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_one_01": "Leave it alone.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_one_02": "Fiddle. Fiddle. Fiddle. Can't you keep your hands still?",

	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_one_04": "Darling, what good do you think can come of that?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_three_01": "Hooray! More skaven! Thank you so much.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_three_02": "Congratulations, darlings. You've found a machine that brings more ratties.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_three_03": "See what happens when you play with ratty toys?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_three_04": "Looks like the ratties don't like us meddling, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_two_01": "Hello? What was that?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_two_02": "Did you hear that?",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_two_03": "I think it's still functional, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_portal_interact_two_04": "Say what you like about ratties, but they build to last. Sometimes.",
	"pbw_portals_raid_trace_01": "Never stood a chance, any of them.",
	"pbw_portals_raid_trace_02": "Pactsworn do like a one-sided fight. I'll be glad to give it to them.",
	"pbw_portals_raid_trace_03": "What a mess. Makes me angry. Things explode when I'm angry.",
	"pbw_portals_raid_trace_04": "Looks like they tried to fight. For all the good that did.",
	"pbw_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_01": "At last. Shall we take a look?",
	"pbw_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_02": "And the way is clear. Well done, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_03": "Now that's an ominous-looking door, but so's everything around here.",
	"pbw_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_04": "Inside we go. I want something to burn.",
	"pbw_portals_stairs_01": "Of all... the tortures... of Drachenfels... stairs are the worst.",

	"pbw_portals_temple_bell_tower_01": "What about the belltower?",
	"pbw_portals_temple_bell_tower_02": "How about the belltower?",
	"pbw_portals_temple_bell_tower_03": "Maybe the belltower shares a cellar, or something?",
	"pbw_portals_temple_bell_tower_04": "We could try the belltower, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_temple_event_01": "Now that's more like it! New friends to immolate!",
	"pbw_portals_temple_event_02": "Come along little Pactsworn... Burn and die...",
	"pbw_portals_temple_event_03": "They're here. Whatever will we do? ",
	"pbw_portals_temple_event_04": "Just in time. Sounds like we're getting friends.",
	"pbw_portals_temple_locked_01": "Why are the doors always locked?",
	"pbw_portals_temple_locked_02": "Well, I guess we're looking for another way in.",

	"pbw_portals_the_map_01": "Well, that's a nightmare of squiggles...",
	"pbw_portals_the_map_02": "Just what we needed, a drunk mapmaker.",

	"pbw_portals_the_map_04": "Are we sure that's even a map?",
	"pbw_portals_the_temple_01": "There's the temple, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_the_temple_02": "That's the temple. I hope the map's still there.",
	"pbw_portals_the_temple_03": "We'll be in that temple before you know it, darlings.",
	"pbw_portals_the_temple_04": "That looks ugly enough to be a Sigmarite temple.",
	"pbw_portals_trail_found_01": "The castle's this way.",
	"pbw_portals_trail_found_02": "This trail should take us most of the way.",
	"pbw_portals_trail_found_03": "Follow the trail, darlings. ",
	"pbw_portals_trail_found_04": "Keep to the path. It can't be far.",
	"pbw_portals_village_raided_01": "So they like picking on the helpless, do they? Perhaps they'd like to try me!",
	"pbw_portals_village_raided_02": "Come out, Pactsworn! I've fires enough for all of you!",
	"pbw_portals_village_raided_03": "The poor souls never stood a chance...",
	"pbw_portals_village_raided_04": "Right! I've a mind to deliver some retribution!",

	"pbw_portals_waystone_02": "I've never been more pleased to see a waystone.",
	"pbw_portals_waystone_03": "A waystone? That's handy. Olesya can return us here after we've had a rest.",
	"pbw_portals_waystone_04": "I vote we hop back to the keep, rest up and return ready for battle, darlings.",
	"pbw_prologue_bardin_free_b_01": "It wasn't the most graceful descent.",
	"pbw_prologue_move_b_01": "She has a point, Markus. I take it you've an exit for us, Olesya Pimenova?",
	"pbw_prologue_move_d_01": "I'm impressed. That's not simple magic.",
	"pbw_prologue_olesya_b_01": "Easy enough to whisper through the Eight, if you know the trick.",
	"pbw_prologue_olesya_b_02": "It's a hard magic to master. I'm impressed.",
	"pbw_prologue_olesya_pimenova_b_01": "Easy enough to whisper through the Eight, if you know the trick.",

	"pbw_py_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_01": "So that's the Blightreaper? I wonder if Lohner will let me study it before he disposes of the thing?",
	"pbw_py_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_01": "The corruption has taken root. Think of what it could teach us, with proper study.",
	"pbw_py_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_01": "We'll have to burn that food. But I should keep a sample, for study.",
	"pbw_py_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_01": "The Steinhäger crest? They are famed for their patronage of the magical arts. Perhaps we could seek them out?",
	"pbw_py_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_01": "Be on the lookout for items of scholarly interest... You never know...",
	"pbw_py_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_01": "I hear there's a stash of tomes in Warehouse 13. A shame we haven't the time to check.",
	"pbw_skaven_stronghold_intro_a_01": "Turn the ratties on themselves? I'll enjoy this one.",
	"pbw_skaven_stronghold_intro_a_02": "Provoking the ratties to self-destructive mischief? Sounds like fun.",
	"pbw_skaven_stronghold_intro_b_01": "Brings back fine memories of the ratties slaughtering one another in Ubersreik.",
	"pbw_skaven_stronghold_intro_b_02": "I doubt the results will be as spectacular as in Ubersreik. Think we need to kill an even bigger rattie for that.",
	"pbw_skaven_stronghold_intro_c_01": "I warn you, my flames are anything but subtle.",
	"pbw_skaven_stronghold_intro_c_02": "Long as I get to scorch them whiskers to tail, I'm a happy woman.",
	"pbw_skittergate_intro_a_01": "A long detailed plan, filled with a worrying amount of 'if's'. And a Skaven portal to top things off.",
	"pbw_skittergate_intro_a_02": "I have to admit, this is the most comprehensive and ambitious suicide plan I've ever heard of, least of all agreed to.",
	"pbw_skittergate_intro_b_01": "Well, they explained exactly why all this madness is necessary. And here we are.",
	"pbw_skittergate_intro_b_02": "It truly seems to be the only way. And we'll get to rob and kill this Gatekeeper lummox. Could be fun.",
	"pbw_skittergate_intro_c_01": "We've never had so much talking before a fight as this one. Let's get on with it!",
	"pbw_skittergate_intro_c_02": "I still think I can melt it to scrap, given enough time. No time to prove it though, so let's go.",
	"pbw_skittergate_power_up_a_01": "We'll have to power the gate up again. If we want to go home, that is.",
	"pbw_skittergate_power_up_a_02": "Sneaky ratty! We're trapped here, unless we find a new power source.",
	"pbw_skittergate_power_up_b_01": "What if we find another warpstone chunk?",
	"pbw_skittergate_power_up_b_02": "Don't despair, darlings. There must be another warpstone chunk around somewhere.",
	"pbw_skittergate_power_up_c_01": "After all, if it's running, we can overcharge it! BOOM!",
	"pbw_skittergate_power_up_c_02": "I'm sure we can be more inventive. Maybe make the thing explode?",

	"pbw_witch_hunter_eaten_06": "Saltzpyre's caught by a Thrasher! This won't be pretty.",
	"pbw_woods_conversation_twentyeight_01": "Ignore him, Markus. He doesn't take well to change.",
	"pbw_woods_conversation_twentyfive_01": "I don't understand it ... Every Sister of the Thorn I ever heard of was bound to Isha, or Ariel, or whatever she calls herself.",
	"pbw_woods_conversation_twentyfive_02": "The finest scholars in the Empire-- Oh, wait. I see where I've gone wrong.",
	"pbw_woods_conversation_twentyfour_01": "I worry about you, Kerillian. What I know of the Cytharai isn't encouraging.",
