Just tell me what to hit, dawri.","pdr_level_elven_ruins_story_six_01":"Yes, well. This is elgi territory, shoddy though it is.

Might be a trap.","pdr_portals_conversation_eleven_02":"I'm sure you'll find out.","pdr_portals_temple_locked_01":"Door's locked.","pdr_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_04":"I don't recognise this, drengbarazi.","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_02":"Got a big mouth, doesn't he?","pdr_castle_vo_blockage_01":"Is there a way through?","pdr_portals_portal_interact_two_01":"You hear that? It means 'stop'.","pdr_bastion_vo_search_cells_02":"See anyone worth saving, dawri?","pdr_portals_temple_event_02":"The search is over, and it's time to fight! (laugh)","pdr_generic_dark_03":"Can't seen much down here.","pdr_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_02":"Forge on, drengbarazi! We can't stay here.","pdr_generic_search_progressing_06":"More of that!","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_04":"Even the dark can't hide something awful lurking up ahead.","pdr_castle_vo_landed_04":"We've come a long way... only not in the direction we intended.","pdr_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_03":"What a tangle of stone this place is. ","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_03":"We're wearing him out! Hold on!","pdr_castle_intro_line_c_02":"Could be worse. Could be gobbos. ","pdr_portals_memory_portals_04":"Grimnir's Beard. Raki portals...","pdr_portals_waystone_02":"A waystone? In Drachenfels? That's handy.","pdr_portals_village_raided_01":"(laugh) Have you courage enough to face a dawi?","pdr_hub_lohner_conversation_nine_01":"Singing, dawri. We call it 'singing'. A lovely ballad about a goat, a seam of gromril and a prospector...","pdr_generic_unexpected_event_02":"Ah... That's not right, is it?","pdr_castle_vo_recognize_02":"I've seen this before... haven't I?","pdr_portals_portal_interact_three_04":"Raki! They seem unhappy. Let's give them good reason!","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_02":"You hear that? There are more!","pdr_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_02":"Isn't the throne room around here? That might be worth a look.","pdr_portals_stairs_02":"Why so slow? Have you not seen stairs before?","pdr_portals_everyone_gone_02":"No sign of survivors, dawri.","pdr_portals_find_survivors_04":"Doesn't look good, dawri, but someone might have survived.","pdr_portals_village_raided_03":"Time to settle some scores, drengbarazi!","pdr_castle_vo_enter_04":"That door looks promising. On we go!","pdr_castle_vo_search_again_03":"Where is that krutazdumi?","pdr_castle_vo_this_way_02":"What's the delay?","pdr_portals_stairs_04":"Did we really come this far down?","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_03":"Oh, be quiet. We've dealt with bigger than you.","pdr_castle_conversation_nine_01":"Aye, I'll do what I can, but I reckon there's more magic than machine about this castle's secrets.","pdr_generic_falling_02":"(scream)","pdr_bastion_conversation_five_01":"Much comfort might that be to us in our tombs, Grimgi.","pdr_bastion_vo_possessed_04":"Look out! They're berserk!","pdr_generic_assemble_02":"Here, drengbarazi!","pdr_portals_kidnapped_traces_02":"If they took captives, they'll be in Drachenfels by now.","pdr_bastion_vo_caves_04":"This cavern deserves better than a bunch of raki and kazaki'dum!","pdr_portals_crypt_event_blood_03":"The more we kill, the more we're feeding that kruting daemon!","pdr_portals_enter_village_04":"Gate's broken. We'll have trouble soon enough.","pdr_archdaemon_response_overheard_02":"Speak up.","pdr_bastion_conversation_three_01":"Me? I don't believe in anything I can't hit with an axe. That proof remains outstanding.","pdr_generic_cold_inside_02":"It's parky in here, dawri.","pdr_portals_enter_village_03":"Weapons up, dawri. There's axe-work inside.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_gate_04":"Let's start with something obvious. Like that gate. And a way past it.","pdr_portals_village_raided_02":"You face warriors now, not farmers!","pdr_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_02":"Not a single umgi to be found, apart from the rotten ones.","pdr_portals_objective_recap_02":"Trust this dawi, not that map. We'll make it through.","pdr_castle_intro_line_b_02":"Just remember, this castle has a reputation for a reason. No foolishness.","pdr_portals_waystone_01":"A waystone? Can we pop back? ","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_04":"Don't fret, umgi! Bardin's here!","pdr_generic_search_complete_01":"There it is!","pdr_portals_crypt_exit_02":"So the map didn't lie. I suppose. Hard to tell, really.","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_04":"Next glorious task: find and kill Nurgloth's daemon. I can't wait!","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_02":"Getting a bit gloomy, isn't it?","pdr_portals_find_survivors_01":"See any survivors?","pdr_castle_vo_trap_switch_04":"Is that switch another trap?","pdr_bastion_vo_entrance_04":"Down we go. Mind your heads, dawri!","pdr_bastion_conversation_five_02":"I like to keep an open mind, that's all.","pdr_hub_lohner_conversation_seven_01":"Of course. A dawi always settles his debts.","pdr_portals_portal_interact_one_02":"Leave it alone, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_blood_pool_03":"Those are some nasty hunks of stone, dawri.","pdr_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_01":"Onwards, dawri. We can't change the past.","pdr_castle_vo_halls_01":"Oho! Now we're getting somewhere.","pdr_hub_lohner_conversation_six_01":"Excellent, dawri! Excellent.","pdr_portals_map_first_clue_02":"So... If that's the statue that's on the map, we can't be far off.","pdr_portals_temple_bell_tower_02":"Has anyone considered the belltower?","pdr_portals_temple_bell_tower_04":"Is there a way through from the belltower?","pdr_archdaemon_response_03":"You're not real.","pdr_castle_conversation_eleven_01":"Is anyone else hearing voices? Whispering, like?","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_01":"Mind your step, dawri. There's... unpleasantness underfoot.","pdr_castle_vo_hello_03":"Bad manners, Pactsworn, not to greet your guests.","pdr_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_01":"Well, that was easier than I expected.","pdr_bastion_vo_caves_02":"This place has real prospects. Shame the Pactsworn don't know a stalactite from a stalagmite.","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_01":"You may leave it to us, umgi!","pdr_castle_vo_blood_pool_02":"Stay clear of those gargoyles. I don't like the look in their eyes.","pdr_portals_intro_line_b_01":"We'll do what we can. Though we may be too late.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_vista_04":"Sure, it looks impressive, but take out two or three buttresses, and it's a pile of stone in the valley.","pdr_generic_reaction_sound_01":"What was that?","pdr_portals_memory_path_04":"Didn't Grimgi nearly lose his hat, last time we were here?","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_01":"Look at him! He's weakening!","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_finale_02":"Looking at this mess, I reckon the ritual's good and done.","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_missile_02":"Get off me, you rancid gob!","pdr_generic_unexpected_event_04":"That's not good.","pdr_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_04":"Look for the heads, dawri. They might be useful.","pdr_generic_falling_04":"(scream)","pdr_portals_crypt_event_demon_voice_01":"A daemon, is it? Oho! I've always wanted a crack at one of those!","pdr_generic_getting_dark_outside_03":"I'll soon need a bit of light to see where I'm going.","pdr_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_01":"You face a dawi now! We'll see who's eternal!","pdr_portals_crypt_event_hole_03":"Go, dawri! While we still can!","pdr_generic_falling_01":"(scream)","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_vista_03":"Say what you like about evil, but it's impressive in the moonlight.","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_01":"Seems the krutazdumi wasn't the real power. We want his daemon.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_vista_02":"Gloomy place, that Drachenfels. Not a hold for light and laughter. Not the sane kind.","pdr_portals_help_search_04":"Oi, wazzok! Come and do your bit!","pdr_portals_crypt_event_blood_02":"Blood's seeping across the floor, dawri!","pdr_archdaemon_response_02":"*wordless growl*","pdr_castle_vo_vista_03":"For all that those mountains look glorious, they'll be riddled with raki and gobbos.","pdr_generic_reaction_sound_02":"I hear you...","pdr_portals_get_out_03":"Fun as this is, we should head out, and soon.","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_04":"There! Do you see?","pdr_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_04":"Falling's easy. Getting back up there might be a mite difficult.","pdr_portals_help_search_02":"Come on, dawri. Everyone help out.","pdr_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_04":"Oho! He's in there. I can smell the kruti!","pdr_generic_reaction_sound_03":"There's a sound.","pdr_generic_cold_outside_02":"A bit parky out here.","pdr_portals_map_second_clue_03":"Foolish umgi, hiding a passage in plain sight. It's something to do with these statues.","pdr_generic_rain_01":"Good, honest rain.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_gate_03":"What about that gate, dawri? Anything like that on the map? Any way around?","pdr_bastion_vo_exiting_pdr_bastion_01":"That kazaki'dum will be in the castle, you'll see. But we'll get him.","pdr_generic_search_complete_02":"That's it.","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_done_03":"That's a fine stench he's left behind.","pdr_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_02":"Up we go, dawri. ","pdr_portals_memory_portals_03":"I remember these. Not fondly, if anyone's asking.","pdr_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_03":"Eternal? Hah! Didn't think so.","pdr_portals_everyone_gone_04":"No survivors. My hopes weren't high, but still...","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_04":"Enough talking. Face a dawi, if you dare!","pdr_portals_map_first_clue_03":"What do you reckon to that statue, dawri?","pdr_portals_the_map_02":"Umgak map for an umgak people...","pdr_castle_intro_line_c_01":"Cheer up, drengbarazi! This'll be fun!","pdr_portals_crypt_event_demon_voice_03":"Don't be shy. Come out and say hello.","pdr_generic_search_complete_03":"Found it!","pdr_castle_vo_hello_01":"*loud* Hello-o! *normal* Strange, I thought there'd be more of an echo.","pdr_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_03":"Big words. Have you actions to back 'em up?","pdr_bastion_intro_line_b_01":"A good place to keep prisoners. Might be we'll find some.","pdr_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_04":"There we go, dawri. Who's going through first?","pdr_portals_map_second_clue_01":"Oho! That's it! The statues guard the passage.","pdr_bastion_intro_line_a_02":"These walls look thick, drengbarazi, but we'll manage.","pdr_portals_objective_recap_03":"A dawi is never lost. Only... misplaced. Map or not, I'll find a way.","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_03":"More to free? That's what I like to hear!","pdr_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_03":"Are we heading up? I think we've had all we're getting from this dungeon.","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_finale_04":"Revolting. Mind you, what can you expect from a Pactsworn. But it means we've trouble ahead.","pdr_castle_vo_traces_one_03":"Well, at least the krutazdumi's left us a trail.","pdr_castle_vo_drop_down_04":"I hope this drop doesn't end in the dungeons.","pdr_bastion_vo_search_cells_01":"Any left alive in here?","pdr_castle_vo_vista_02":"A dawi could get used to that view.","pdr_generic_search_start_01":"Can you see it?","pdr_portals_intro_line_a_02":"One delay after another. We've got to get to the village before the raki.","pdr_generic_objective_complete_03":"Grimnir's Axe, we've done it!","pdr_generic_objective_complete_01":"Done it!","pdr_portals_conversation_five_02":"I wonder who he answers to... I like to know who I'm dealing with.","pdr_portals_objective_recap_04":"If only that map made sense. Still, what can you expect of umgi?","pdr_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_02":"You going to brag all day, or are you going to fight?","pdr_bastion_vo_search_cells_04":"Are there any prisoners? We'd best check, dawri.","pdr_portals_memory_path_03":"You know, I saved Azumgi's life just by that rock there.","pdr_generic_path_blocked_03":"This umgak's in the way!","pdr_castle_vo_hello_04":"Are we getting a fight, or what?","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_missile_04":"Rotten little orb's following me around!","pdr_portals_raid_trace_01":"You'll note they didn't try this on a dawi hold.","pdr_castle_vo_hello_02":"Where is everyone?","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_03":"Never understood ritual. All that waving about and singing, and nary a tankard to hand.","pdr_portals_portal_interact_two_04":"Stop meddling with the kruting thing!","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_03":"Smells like malice up ahead. Malice and magic.","pdr_portals_trail_found_02":"We'll see the castle before long, I'll warrant.","pdr_portals_conversation_eleven_01":"You ever get the feeling you're being watched, Azumgi?","pdr_portals_portal_event_02":"We've only got that portal running!","pdr_portals_portal_interact_one_04":"What are you expecting to happen, anyway?","pdr_portals_portal_interact_one_01":"Don't meddle with raki machines.","pdr_generic_assemble_04":"Come to me!","pdr_generic_cold_inside_03":"Gone a bit cold in here.","pdr_portals_portal_interact_two_02":"It's not entirely broken. That's not good.","pdr_generic_path_blocked_01":"We need to get through!","pdr_bastion_intro_line_b_02":"There might be prisoners below. A hero's work is never done.","pdr_portals_stairs_03":"I think I'm getting dizzy.","pdr_portals_trail_found_04":"Stick to this trail, dawri. I'll let you know if it veers wrong.","pdr_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_01":"This looks promising, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_this_way_01":"You waiting for a gromril-engraved invitation, dawri?","pdr_portals_intro_line_b_02":"Doesn't seem likely we'll manage it.","pdr_portals_stairs_01":"Hurry up, dawri. It's only a few stairs.","pdr_portals_raid_trace_02":"So much death, and for what? We'll find out, dawri.","pdr_portals_the_temple_03":"That's the temple we want, sure enough.","pdr_portals_temple_event_03":"We timed that well. Ready to fight, dawri?","pdr_castle_intro_line_a_01":"So the krutazdumi's in there, is he?","pdr_portals_everyone_gone_03":"Looks like they killed them all, or took 'em elsewhere.","pdr_portals_get_out_02":"They'll keep coming, so we'd best be going.","pdr_generic_getting_dark_outside_04":"It's getting darker...","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_road_01":"Is that map any use at all?","pdr_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_01":"Look at that... Someone's smashed the gargoyles...","pdr_portals_conversation_two_01":"Aye, true enough. I've never heard a story about Drachenfels that matches historical record.","pdr_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_03":"I don't know... The Pactsworn can't even smash statues properly...","pdr_castle_vo_vista_04":"Leagues from anywhere. Just how I like it.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_vista_01":"Impressive enough, but it's not dawi-craft, is it?","pdr_bastion_intro_line_c_01":"We'll manage, dawri. We always do.","pdr_castle_vo_this_way_04":"Get over here, drengbarazi!","pdr_castle_vo_secret_door_01":"A secret door! That's more like it!","pdr_generic_reaction_action_03":"Oho!","pdr_portals_temple_locked_03":"Someone's locked the door. An untrustworthy sort, I'm sure.","pdr_portals_crypt_exit_04":"Nice to be back in the fresh air, isn't it dawri?","pdr_generic_search_progressing_03":"Just like that.","pdr_portals_waystone_04":"Take it from an old hand, dawri. Get rest where you can. We'll be back soon enough.","pdr_bastion_vo_search_cells_03":"Check every cell. We don't want to miss someone.","pdr_castle_vo_trap_switch_02":"Have we learnt our lesson about pulling strange switches?","pdr_generic_dark_01":"Oh. It's gone all dark.","pdr_castle_vo_blood_pool_04":"A blood fountain? What's wrong with ale?","pdr_archdaemon_response_overheard_03":"Didn't catch that, dawri.","pdr_generic_search_progressing_02":"That's the way.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_gate_02":"Surely that gate's marked? Is there another path?","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_02":"Rituals and nonsense. What's wrong with a few good runes?","pdr_castle_vo_vista_01":"Look at those mountains. Have you ever seen a fairer sight?","pdr_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_03":"I've not seen a single prisoner...","pdr_portals_get_to_temple_01":"Didn't Lohner say something about a secret map, hidden in a temple?","pdr_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_03":"That's no ordinary smell. The krutazdumi's close.","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_02":"Just a little longer, dawri! He's getting sleepy!","pdr_generic_unexpected_event_03":"Oh...","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_02":"We'll need to find the krutazdumi's daemon if we want this ended, dawri.","pdr_portals_follow_trail_04":"There's nothing left in this village for us, dawri.","pdr_generic_falling_03":"(scream)","pdr_generic_search_complete_04":"That's the one! Well done!","pdr_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_03":"Maybe we'll get lucky elsewhere?","pdr_portals_crypt_exit_03":"That could have gone better, but we're where we wanted to be.","pdr_portals_help_search_01":"Too good to lend a hand, are you?","pdr_portals_raid_trace_04":"If only we'd been here earlier, drengbarazi.","pdr_castle_vo_blockage_04":"What can we do about that umgak?","pdr_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_01":"Too late. We're making a habit of that.","pdr_castle_vo_landed_03":"Oh, well done, dawri.","pdr_portals_everyone_gone_01":"Barren as an elgi's conscience. No one living, not around here.","pdr_generic_assemble_01":"Hurry up, dawri!","pdr_generic_search_start_02":"Where is it?","pdr_generic_path_blocked_02":"We can't let that stand in our way!","pdr_portals_kidnapped_traces_01":"Looks like they took prisoners. They'll be in Drachenfels by now.","pdr_portals_kidnapped_traces_03":"Boga! Lohner was right about them taking captives.","pdr_portals_raid_trace_03":"There's no satisfaction in killing the helpless, not unless you're a worthless kruti.","pdr_generic_success_02":"A job well done, dawri.","pdr_portals_trail_found_03":"This feels right... and wrong. Right direction, wrong smell.","pdr_bastion_vo_exiting_pdr_bastion_02":"We'll be heading into the castle next, when we're ready. That kazaki'dum can't hide.","pdr_portals_waystone_03":"Looks like we've a chance to rest up before we tangle with the next bit, dawri.","pdr_generic_search_progressing_04":"Seems to work.","pdr_castle_vo_enter_01":"Well, that door seems to be the way forward.","pdr_portals_find_map_01":"Right. Now find that map.","pdr_bastion_vo_entrance_02":"You'll not hear me lamenting a tunnel, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_search_again_01":"Now then... Where's that krutazdumi?","pdr_generic_reaction_action_01":"Oi!","pdr_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_01":"We'd better find a way back upstairs.","pdr_portals_temple_locked_02":"Well, don't just stand there, dawri. Look for another way in.","pdr_generic_cold_outside_01":"Bit chilly, isn't it?","pdr_castle_vo_recognize_03":"This all looks familiar... I think.","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_missile_03":"That's cheating! Why's it following me?","pdr_generic_rain_02":"Lovely bit of drizzle, this.","pdr_portals_intro_line_c_02":"Well, we've heroic hearts, steady arms and, if Lohner spoke true, a map to find. ","pdr_portals_portal_interact_three_01":"Now look what you've done!","pdr_portals_the_temple_04":"I see the temple, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_03":"D'you reckon the krutazdumi's in the throne room?","pdr_portals_intro_line_c_01":"We'll just have to grab that map Lohner spoke of, and break some heads in Drachenfels.","pdr_generic_reaction_action_02":"What?","pdr_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_03":"Off we go, dawri. We need to find a way back upstairs.","pdr_portals_conversation_four_02":"Is that so? Doesn't sound good.","pdr_castle_vo_halls_02":"Are we back in the castle?","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_01":"Oi! Wazzok! Pay attention, and you might learn something!","pdr_generic_getting_dark_outside_01":"Getting darker. Watch your step, dawri.","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_03":"A prisoner! At last!","pdr_generic_door_locked_04":"Locked, dawri!","pdr_portals_map_first_clue_01":"Hello. That statue... I think it's marked.","pdr_portals_get_to_temple_02":"If we don't fancy a frontal assault, perhaps we should find that map Lohner talked about. The one in the temple.","pdr_castle_vo_recognize_01":"This place itches at my memory.","pdr_portals_find_map_03":"Best get looking for the map.","pdr_castle_vo_blood_pool_01":"Not the place to slake your thirst, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_drop_down_02":"Down we go!","pdr_portals_village_raided_04":"Raiders! Not worth killing, but I'll make an exception, this once.","pdr_portals_find_survivors_03":"I suppose there might be survivors...","pdr_bastion_conversation_four_01":"Not to my knowledge. This whole stretch of mountain has a bleak reputation. Gromril would draw us near, but nothing less.","pdr_bastion_vo_entrance_03":"Down into the depths, is it? (laugh)","pdr_hub_lohner_conversation_ten_01":"Oho! Too rich for you, was it?","pdr_bastion_vo_exiting_pdr_bastion_03":"A good rest, then we'll see what's to be had in the castle, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_04":"We've missed something. I know we have. I just don't know what.","pdr_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_01":"If there's a way in, there's a way out. I hope.","pdr_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_01":"It's open. Down into the depths we go.","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_01":"There! Fear not, umgi! A dawi comes for you!","pdr_portals_crypt_event_demon_voice_02":"Wait. What was that?","pdr_archdaemon_response_01":"That's not true.","pdr_portals_the_map_01":"Call that a map?","pdr_portals_crypt_event_hole_01":"Over there, dawri! A way out!","pdr_generic_search_progressing_07":"Quickly! Again!","pdr_castle_vo_search_again_02":"Is there any sign of that krutazdumi?","pdr_castle_vo_recognize_04":"Didn't we pass this way last time?","pdr_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_04":"You know, he could be in the throne room. It's not far.","pdr_portals_conversation_nine_02":"Wouldn't be fun, otherwise.","pdr_castle_conversation_seven_02":"I know the feeling. It's always cold here, isn't it? Even with a fire raging close by.","pdr_castle_vo_landed_01":"It's been a while since I fell for that one.","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_finale_03":"That's a sight, and no mistake. Reckon the ritual's done.","pdr_generic_door_locked_03":"Locked up tight!","pdr_portals_enter_village_01":"Looks like the Pactsworn beat us to it.","pdr_castle_vo_halls_03":"Looks like we're back in the castle, dawri.","pdr_castle_vo_secret_door_03":"Oh, it's a secret door. Thank Valaya.","pdr_portals_find_map_02":"So where's the map, dawri?","pdr_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_04":"Mind your step. This place could be full of traps.","pdr_generic_cold_outside_03":"No complaining. A bit of cold does you good.","pdr_castle_vo_traces_one_04":"You reckon we can follow that muck to the krutazdumi, dawri?","pdr_portals_intro_line_a_01":"Come along, drengbarazi. We need to reach Blutberg before it's too late.","pdr_portals_help_search_03":"What's the delay? This'll be fun. Like seeking out buried treasure.","pdr_castle_vo_secret_door_02":"A secret door! Well made, too.","pdr_portals_temple_bell_tower_01":"I reckon the belltower might be worth a look.","pdr_generic_cold_inside_04":"Shouldn't be so chilly inside.","pdr_castle_conversation_seven_01":"I'd have thought this'd make a good border fortress for the Empire.","pdr_generic_door_locked_01":"It's locked!","pdr_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_02":"Boga! Another dungeon. Can we get back out? That's the question.","pdr_portals_find_survivors_02":"Did anyone survive?","pdr_portals_memory_path_02":"Remember last time, dawri? I was heroic. But then, aren't I always?","pdr_portals_portal_interact_three_02":"Raki! What made you think we needed more raki?","pdr_castle_vo_door_open_02":"The door's open? That's unexpected.","pdr_portals_conversation_four_01":"Odd how we keep revisiting old triumphs, eh wutelgi? First Ubersreik, now this.","pdr_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_02":"Headless gargoyles? Well, it takes all sorts.","pdr_generic_reaction_sound_04":"What's that?","pdr_portals_get_out_04":"Clear a path, drengbarazi. We need to get moving!","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_finale_01":"Looks like we're too late to stop the ritual.","pdr_portals_follow_trail_01":"Yes, this is the way.","pdr_portals_memory_path_01":"Oho! This takes me back.","pdr_portals_kidnapped_traces_04":"Signs of struggle and the prisoners dragged away uphill. To that castle.","pdr_generic_success_03":"Nicely done, drengbarazi.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_road_03":"Well? What does the map say?","pdr_portals_crypt_event_blood_01":"The floor's filling with blood!","pdr_bastion_vo_caves_03":"Look at it! A handsome cavern, all going to wrack and ruin!","pdr_castle_intro_line_a_02":"Are we hunting down this krutazdumi, dawri?","pdr_generic_success_01":"Success! At last!","pdr_portals_get_out_01":"We're not making much progress.","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_04":"Rituals? These Pactsworn do like to show off, don't they?","pdr_portals_the_temple_02":"We're on the right track.","pdr_generic_assemble_03":"Come here, dawri!","pdr_portals_portal_event_03":"Switch it off! Switch it off!","pdr_portals_the_map_03":"Lot of nonsense, that. Still, we've got it now.","pdr_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_03":"My beard's bristling. Something's watching us.","pdr_portals_crypt_event_blood_04":"Boga! We're feeding that daemon. See the blood on the floor?","pdr_bastion_conversation_three_02":"I can hit the wind, right enough. But it's cowardly, and parts beneath the blow. ","pdr_portals_portal_event_01":"That kruting portal's alive!","pdr_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_02":"Aha! A survivor! Set him free, dawri!","pdr_bastion_vo_possessed_03":"They're fighting like dumali!","pdr_generic_cold_inside_01":"Why's it so cold in here?","pdr_castle_vo_traces_one_01":"I'm not touching that!

Krutazdumi-hunting.","pdr_generic_search_start_03":"Look around, dawri.","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_missile_01":"Oi! This muck's following me!","pdr_bastion_intro_line_c_02":"You worry too much, dawri. Let's just enjoy ourselves.","pdr_bastion_intro_line_a_01":"Here we go, drengbarazi - another fortress to storm!","pdr_portals_temple_event_01":"Oho! We've wazzoks inbound, dawri!","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_03":"This isn't over 'til Nurgloth's daemon's done with.","pdr_portals_portal_interact_two_03":"If that explodes and kills me, you'll not hear the last of it.","pdr_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_04":"It's a big place. Perhaps there are other captives elsewhere?","pdr_archdaemon_response_04":"*wordless growl*","pdr_portals_map_second_clue_04":"Of course! It's the statues. They're guardians.","pdr_castle_vo_traces_one_02":"I think that krutazdumi's been leaking, dawri.","pdr_hub_lohner_conversation_eight_01":"I appreciate the effort, but not so loud, eh?","pdr_portals_conversation_twelve_01":"Oh, I feel at home everywhere, Zharrinn. It's a sort of knack, I suppose.","pdr_portals_find_map_04":"Start digging around for that map.","pdr_portals_conversation_nine_01":"Aye, that it is, Azumgi. A shame we don't have time to explore. I bet these peaks hold all manner of treasures.","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_road_04":"Can you see owt that matches the map?","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_road_02":"D'you see any landmarks, dawri? Are they on the map?","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_01":"Anyone else feel like something's not right?","pdr_portals_temple_event_04":"Just as I was getting bored! Weapons up, dawri!","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_done_04":"Gone! No mettle, these kazaki'dum!","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_04":"Nearly there. See? He's weakening!","pdr_generic_search_progressing_01":"I've a good feeling about this.","pdr_castle_vo_blockage_02":"Look at that umgak. Can we clear it?","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_done_01":"He's gone, but that stench remains.","pdr_castle_vo_enter_02":"How about that door, dawri?","pdr_portals_map_second_clue_02":"I have it, dawri! The statues are guardians.","pdr_portals_memory_portals_02":"Oh, raki portals. Good job they're not working.","pdr_portals_follow_trail_02":"Drachenfels isn't far. This all feels familiar.","pdr_portals_memory_portals_01":"Raki tinkering, is it?","pdr_castle_vo_door_open_01":"Not often we get a welcome, dawri.","pdr_portals_crypt_exit_01":"Well, we're here.","pdr_portals_enter_village_02":"Trouble arrived before we did, I'd say.","pdr_generic_search_start_04":"We'll have to search, dawri!","pdr_portals_conversation_twelve_02":"Don't be a spoilsport, Azumgi. There's no sense letting all that troll fat go to waste, is there?","pdr_archdaemon_response_overheard_01":"Eh? Did you speak?","pdr_generic_path_blocked_04":"We're on the wrong side of this lot.","pdr_generic_success_04":"That wasn't so hard, was it?","pdr_generic_dark_02":"Gloomy as a penniless merchant.","pdr_bastion_vo_exiting_pdr_bastion_04":"We are going to come back, aren't we?

Don't just go pulling that switch!","pdr_castle_vo_drop_down_01":"I hope this drop's shorter.","pdr_portals_crypt_event_demon_voice_04":"Well, that's ominous.","pdr_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_03":"There's the door. Let's hope it's the right one.","pdr_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_04":"No one cares, krutazdumi! ","pdr_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_02":"He's in there, isn't he? There's a peculiar stench.","pdr_castle_vo_enter_03":"I can't see anything for it but that door, drengbarazi.","pdr_portals_crypt_event_hole_04":"Into the hole? Well, it could be worse. I think.","pdr_castle_vo_this_way_03":"What's the matter, dawri? Sleepy? Come on!","pdr_bastion_vo_finale_done_02":"So much for that wazzok!","pdr_portals_crypt_event_hole_02":"I hope it's better down there than it is up here.","pdr_generic_search_progressing_05":"We've the hang of this now, dawri.","pdr_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_02":"Something foul down here, dawri.","pdr_generic_door_locked_02":"Umgak thing won't open!","pdr_bastion_vo_possessed_01":"Grungni's Hammer! They're crazed!","pdr_generic_cold_outside_04":"Brisk around here, isn't it?","pdr_castle_vo_secret_door_04":"Let's hope that door gets us back on track, eh?","pdr_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_02":"Another one falls! Well fought, dawri.","pdr_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_01":"A ritual, eh? Sounds like a job for, well, us!","pdr_portals_pdr_castle_gate_01":"Can't climb that gate. Is that on the map?","pdr_portals_portal_interact_three_03":"This is what happens when you meddle with raki machines!","pdr_portals_the_map_04":"That's not a map. Someone sneezed and was a bit slow wiping it up!","pdr_portals_objective_recap_01":"I hope that map's more useful than it looks.","pdr_generic_dark_04":"Oi! It's gone a bit dark.","pdr_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_02":"None of this looks familiar.","pdr_portals_portal_event_04":"It's working!","pdr_portals_conversation_five_01":"You ever hear Lohner talk about his superiors before, Saltzpyre?","pdr_castle_vo_halls_04":"Here we go. Back where we wanted to be.","pdr_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_01":"I reckon we're near the throne room. We should check there.","pdr_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_01":"I don't remember this bit, dawri.","pdr_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_04":"I think we're too late, drengbarazi.","pdr_castle_intro_line_b_01":"Keep cool heads, dawri. We don't want to go charging into a trap.","pdr_portals_follow_trail_03":"This way, dawri. Trust me. I never get lost.","pdr_castle_vo_landed_02":"There's a lesson in this somewhere.","pdr_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_01":"We'll head up, see what's on the surface.","pdr_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_04":"We'll try 'up top'. You never know...","pdr_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_04":"All puff, no staying power. Just like all kazaki'dum.","pdr_bastion_vo_caves_01":"Aye, not bad. Could use a dawi's touch, mind.","pdr_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_03":"There's a peculiar itch in my brain. Might be a louse, I suppose.","pdr_generic_getting_dark_outside_02":"Could use a bit of light down here.","pdr_songbook_one_05":"#Though you leave me, brynling lass, I'll not soon forget thee. My grudge will keep me forge-wrought warm, as yours will do for thee.#","pdr_songbook_one_01":"#Oh, where have all gobbos gone? Why have they all run away? Where have all the gobbos gone? Why won't they come out and play?#","pdr_songbook_one_03":"#I'm the Pirate King of Barak Varr! Yo-ho! Yo-ho! They sing my name both near and far! Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Yo-ho!#","pdr_songbook_one_08":"#Oh Karak Drazh, I long to see you, and drive the gobbos from your hall ... [Humming]#","pdr_songbook_one_04":"#One last league, and that's the end. I'll stow my shield, my hearth I'll tend.#","pdr_songbook_one_06":"#The Wrath of Grimnir wakes and roars ... [Humming]#","pdr_songbook_one_02":"#Ya-hoi, boys! Ya-hoi, boys! We're marching with the dawn! Yo-ho, boys! Yo-ho, boys! We're off to Karak Norn!#","pdr_songbook_one_07":"#The Mountain stood proud, and so shall I. Neither wind nor rain shall wear me down.#","pdr_songbook_one_09":"#My father's axe may be old and worn, but its drengi days go on and on ... #","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentyeight_01":"So, an 'Old Alliance' between Loren and Bretonnia, eh? Have you told Kruber the rest?","pdr_fleur_conversation_six_01":"Still can't get my head around this Grail knight business, Azumgi.","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentythree_02":"Calls you 'peasant' too, I notice.","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentyeight_02":"The harm? Every summer, that king of yours treats Bretonnia as his own private hunting ground. Two legs or four, doesn't bother him.","pdr_fleur_conversation_seven_01":"Didn't you take an oath to the Emperor? Won't he be a bit, you know, peeved?","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentyseven_02":"Gracious sort. Had a fierce beastie of a horse, but kept slowing it down so I could keep up. Gave me a pedigree pony, after.","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentyseven_03":"Roasted a treat, it did.","pdr_fleur_conversation_eight_02":"Bad blood between your realms. Makes folk petty.","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentythree_01":"Have you notice how Azumgi keeps speaking of himself in the 3rd person? All this 'knight of the grail' nonsense?","pdr_fleur_conversation_twentyseven_01":"I fought alongside the Duke of Parravon once, did I ever tell you?","pdr_fleur_conversation_six_02":"Wouldn't have it any other way. Long as you've not gone soft.","pdr_fleur_conversation_eight_01":"You sure the Empire won't want your medals back, Azumgi?","pdr_fleur_conversation_eight_03":"You what?","pdr_fleur_conversation_seven_02":"Yes, but what about the folk beneath him?","pdr_fleur_conversation_five_01":"Doesn't it worry you, being a Grail knight after years of Imperial service. It's got to be strange.","pdr_fleur_conversation_seven_03":"Aye, well, we've all done that.","pdr_fleur_conversation_five_02":"You're not worried about, erm, reprisals?","pdr_whispers_conversation_three_01":"Never you mind! ... I don't want to talk about it. Private matter.","pdr_whisper_conversation_twelve_01":"So... I keep thinking about Castle Drachenfels...","pdr_comet_conversation_three_02":"Eh? Well, at least there'll be plenty to do. Can't abide being bored.","pdr_comet_conversation_three_01":"I have! Not much of a portent, is it? The world's already gone mad.","pdr_whisper_conversation_twelve_02":"Better we never speak of the business again?","pdr_comet_conversation_seven_02":"Hrmph. Didn't say that, did I? One dwarf's sometimes enough... if he's the right dwarf.","pdr_whisper_conversation_twelve_03":"Aye, that's probably true.","pdr_comet_conversation_seven_01":"A stalwart alliance, you mean Thorgrim... Hang on, you're talking about me, aren't you. That's not dwarfs, but dwarf. Singular.","pdr_whisper_conversation_eight_01":"Nothing to talk about. I was heroic ... and the others had their moments, if I'm being generous.","pdr_cog_conversation_two_02":"Aye, it is that. They mean well, but it's not the same.","pdr_cog_conversation_ten_02":"Well, now he can rebuild it better, can't he?","pdr_cog_conversation_five_01":"Why do I reckon you already know the answer?","pdr_cog_conversation_eleven_02":"Not at all. It's a privilege to learn from the longbeards ... those whose beards haven't burned off.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyfour_02":"It's not so simple as that. I'm more what you could describe as 'self taught'.","pdr_cog_conversation_one_01":"Aye, you hear that, do you? From who?","pdr_cog_trailer_04":"No kruting patience…","pdr_cog_conversation_sixteen_02":"Hmmm... We'll discuss it some more. Can't promise anything, mind.","pdr_cog_conversation_six_03":"Life's complicated. Not everything's forever.","pdr_cog_conversation_seven_01":"Always was, Zharrin, in my heart. Just letting it shine a bit, that's all.","pdr_cog_conversation_ten_01":"Explosions! That was just a wee accident, that's all. Could've happened to anyone.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyfive_02":"Pffff. I did write the combination down.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyseven_01":"I appreciate the effort, Lohner. Just make sure she doesn't know I'm looking for her.","pdr_cog_trailer_01":"Where are we going? Over the mountains!","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyfour_04":"I know. I find it liberating.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentysix_01":"Weren't your place to speak on the matter.","pdr_cog_conversation_eight_02":"That's what you get for misjudging the flashpoint of black powder, Zharrin. Foolish umgi never learn.","pdr_cog_conversation_one_02":"Lohner should keep his mouth shut.","pdr_cog_conversation_eight_01":"We'd be talking about umgi engineers, I take it?","pdr_cog_trailer_03_":"We’re leaving now!","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyfive_01":"Aye, what of it?","pdr_cog_conversation_twelve_01":"Maybe ... Be strange to see the place after all these years.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_04":"Morgrim's got something for you!","pdr_cog_conversation_three_03":"None of your business!","pdr_cog_conversation_fifteen_02":"Can't argue with that. They come back often enough as it is.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentythree_04":"He thought that too. Can't say he was wholly right about it.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_07":"Opening up!","pdr_cog_conversation_nine_02":"I did say 'when I want to be'. A good stomp scares off bad luck!","pdr_cog_conversation_fourteen_02":"Yes, but a large part of that is getting the complaining in up front.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_02":"Zharraz!","pdr_cog_conversation_fourteen_01":"Oh, so this is how it's going to be is it? Fixing other peoples' weapons?","pdr_cog_conversation_twenty_03":"Is a comfort in trying times, I'm sure.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_08":"Heads down, dawri!","pdr_cog_trailer_02":"One last adjustment…","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyeight_01":"Should've done it years ago. Those raki had better beware now!","pdr_cog_conversation_nine_01":"And I don't have it, is that what you're saying? I can be deft when I need to be.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyone_01":"There are few pleasures to equal the making of something. But you'd know that. Your father was a blacksmith wasn't he?","pdr_cog_conversation_four_02":"Took the burden for his brother, who died a hero getting other miners to safety. Wouldn't expect you to understand.","pdr_cog_conversation_three_01":"You were asking about my kin, before... What did Lohner tell you?","pdr_cog_conversation_twentytwo_02":"We are still talking about my weapons, aren't we?","pdr_cog_conversation_eighteen_02":"I'm not arguing ... but no one lives in the past like a Longbeard. Except maybe Saltzpyre.","pdr_cog_conversation_eleven_01":"Aye, it does. But I'm not an engineer, not officially. Haven't stood my service in the guild.","pdr_cog_conversation_eighteen_01":"It's a love of tradition, Azumgi. They don't like change.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentysix_02":"Aye? Then you'll be happy for me to share what I've learned about you, won't you?","pdr_cog_conversation_two_01":"Ha! Come to make another joke at my expense?","pdr_cog_conversation_twentytwo_01":"First, I need to work the kinks out of those I've already got. Perfection's important.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyone_02":"Aye. I think he reckons that with the end of the world coming, there's no point in secrets any more.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_09":"Now this is firepower!","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_10":"Yahahahahaha!","pdr_cog_conversation_six_01":"Do I have no secrets left?","pdr_cog_conversation_fifteen_01":"You were at the Battle of Hel Fenn?","pdr_cog_conversation_sixteen_01":"Are you serious, Azumgi?","pdr_cog_conversation_five_02":"Aye, I do, and a canny lass she is too. Has forgotten more about engineering that I ever learned. Captains a monitor out of Barak Varr nowadays.","pdr_cog_trailer_03":"Careful... that’s it… little bit more… there...","pdr_cog_conversation_twenty_02":"That our gods were real, and remain so. Sigmar--","pdr_cog_conversation_seven_02":"Aye, I've noticed.","pdr_cog_trailer_05":"Now I'm ready.","pdr_cog_conversation_thirteen_02":"I shan't dignify that with a response.","pdr_cog_conversation_thirtythree_01":"I see you've made a change, Azumgi. Looks good on you.","pdr_cog_conversation_twentythree_02":"Aye, he was certainly that. Rigid. Inflexible. Certain of everything.","pdr_cog_conversation_nineteen_02":"They're propping him up, you mean? Very true.","pdr_cog_conversation_six_02":"Hmph. Yes, Grelda's a dab hand with an axe. You should see her when she's the scent of gobbo blood in her nostrils. You'd like her.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_01":"Zaraz-Zharr!","pdr_cog_conversation_twelve_02":"Can't say I'd know until I got there, Zharrin.","pdr_cog_conversation_nineteen_01":"Aye, maybe a little. But we're not so factional as you umgi. Plenty of room for all the ancestors.","pdr_cog_conversation_seventeen_01":"Aye, Azumgi. Ever since I was the most beardless of beardlings.","pdr_cog_conversation_four_01":"The mining accident at Karak Norn. It was my father's fault. Disengaged the pneumatic supports - called 'em newfangled umgak. Then the quake hit.","pdr_cog_conversation_thirteen_01":"Might be - but don't you go confusing me with a common tinkerer. I'm an artist.","pdr_cog_conversation_three_02":"Hnn. Weren't like that ...","pdr_cog_conversation_twenty_01":"Ancestor God, Grimgi. The difference means something.","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_06":"Bringing pain!","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_03":"Taste Morgrim's wrath!","pdr_activate_ability_dwarf_engineer_05":"Got something for you!","pdr_cog_conversation_twentyseven_02":"Not my family. All we do is quarrel. But it'd be good to know she's alive."}
