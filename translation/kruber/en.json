	"pes_bastion_vo_entrance_01": "Underground? Yeah, why not? It'll make a change.",
	"pes_bastion_vo_entrance_02": "Looks like this'll take us through, but watch for unpleasantness.",

	"pes_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_02": "Won't stop me putting my foot up your arse, will it?",
	"pes_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_03": "Oh look, another maniac. Our speciality.",
	"pes_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_04": "Don't lose heart, mates. We can take him!",
	"pes_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_01": "He's getting weaker!",

	"pes_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_01": "Time to head into the light, I reckon.",
	"pes_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_02": "We'll head up, see what's what up there.",

	"pes_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_04": "Nothing more for us in these dungeons. Let's head up.",

	"pes_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_03": "Well, we're here now. Let's keep going, see what we find.",
	"pes_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_04": "We can at least make the Pactsworn pay, can't we?",
	"pes_bastion_vo_possessed_01": "Taal! They're possessed!",

	"pes_bastion_vo_search_cells_04": "Hello? Anyone here?",
	"pes_bell_intro_a_01": "I suppose this has to be done. The bell isn't just our problem, is it?",
	"pes_bell_intro_a_02": "We did it in Ubersreik, we'll do it here. Enforcing a strict no rat-bell policy.",
	"pes_bell_intro_b_01": "Why bells though? I don't get it. Rats should worship cheese or something.",
	"pes_bell_intro_b_02": "Don't see why, but the ratmen do love their bells. That's why I love cracking them.",
	"pes_bell_intro_c_01": "Usual drill, mates. We stay together, we win, and they die.",
	"pes_bell_intro_c_02": "Ready for another go then, mates? They have the numbers, but we've got me.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_eighteen_01": "From my worldly sins? I'm not sure we've got time for that, to be honest.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_eighteen_02": "Oh yeah? Very generous. Thanks.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_eight_01": "Well,  Saltzpyre's faith burns stronger than ever.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_five_01": "Yeah. Sigmar can work miracles, but he's got his limits.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_nineteen_01": "No no no no. No, I'm quite happy with a pantheon at my back, thank you very much. Strength in numbers has always served the Empire well.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_nineteen_02": "Good to know. But don't hold your breath.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_nine_01": "Don't be so hasty, Sienna. What's more important - Saltzpyre's unhappiness, or saving the Empire?",
	"pes_bless_conversation_seventeen_01": "Sigmar's voice, then? I always imagined him to be a big, booming presence. Like thunder.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_seventeen_02": "You sure about that? I mean, Bardin snores something fierce. Could be you've mistaken one for the other.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_seventeen_03": "Guess we'll find out, one way or another.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_seven_01": "I dunno. Doesn't really seem that different to me.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_sixteen_01": "So, what's it like? Having actually heard Sigmar's voice?",
	"pes_bless_conversation_sixteen_02": "You'll forgive me for saying so, but 'humble' ain't exactly a word I'd peg you with.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_six_01": "Long may it last, says I. We'll make a human being of him yet.",
	"pes_bless_conversation_twenty_01": "So ... Oh Herald of Sigmar ... Any chance of the big guy actually helping us out?",
	"pes_bless_conversation_twenty_02": "That wasn't exactly a 'yes', now was it?",
	"pes_bright_weave_conversation_one_01_2nd_line_var": "Easy for you to say. Some of us are flammable.",
	"pes_bright_weave_conversation_three_01_3rd_line_var": "Yeah, our pointy-ear's better than that. She'd not do anything... Ignore me. Can't think why I said that.",
	"pes_bright_weave_conversation_two_01_1st_line_var": "Too bloody hot in here. Too bloody hot by far.",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_01": "Oi! Spawn got Sienna! Don't let it chew off anything important!",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_02": "Spawn just grabbed Sienna! Pester that thing, mates... make it hurt!",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_03": "Taal's tankard, Spawn's hungry for Sienna! Better put it down quick!",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_04": "Quickly, slay that spawn before it gobbles up our wizard!",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_05": "Spawn's gut-wrenchingly horrible, and Sienna's got one up close! Kill it! Now!",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_06": "If I don't kill that awful thing, I'll lose my mind! And now it's got our wizard!",
	"pes_bright_wizard_eaten_07": "Next time we're up against spawn, we better bring more booze. Hey! Don't you eat our wizard! All the same, more booze for the rest of us, hah!",
	"pes_castle_conversation_eight_01": "Back when I was in Talabheim, I chanced upon a band of strolling players. They were talking about performing a play about Drachenfels.",
	"pes_castle_conversation_eight_02": "Couldn't tell you. When I went back that evening, they'd all been rounded up and dragged away by your lot. Half the audience, too.",
	"pes_castle_conversation_one_01": "Did you see the size of those spiderwebs?",
	"pes_castle_conversation_six_01": "Some of this looks how I remember it, but the rest? Baffling, is what it is.",
	"pes_castle_conversation_six_02": "But not you, eh?",
	"pes_castle_conversation_ten_01": "Killed many daemonologists have you, sir?",
	"pes_castle_conversation_three_01": "So, what's Parravon like?",
	"pes_castle_conversation_three_02": "Only time I've been to Bretonnia was while campaigning. Bit of loot and pillage. Good times.",
	"pes_castle_conversation_twelve_01": "D'you hear that? There's a voice. It... It knows things about me.",
	"pes_castle_conversation_twelve_02": "Yeah? And what if it's not?",
	"pes_castle_conversation_two_01": "Did I hear you say you'd seen Drachenfels, Kerillian. Back in Parravon?",
	"pes_castle_conversation_two_02": "No shortage of evil in the world. Full to the bloody brim with it, we are.",
	"pes_castle_intro_line_a_01": "Hunting a chaos sorcerer through the halls of Castle Drachenfels? Life hates me.",
	"pes_castle_intro_line_a_02": "Well, let's get to it. That sorcerer's not gonna find and kill himself, is he? Worse luck.",
	"pes_castle_intro_line_b_01": "No silly risks now. This could get sticky.",
	"pes_castle_intro_line_b_02": "There could be an army waiting for us in there. Probably is.",
	"pes_castle_intro_line_c_01": "This is not how I saw the day going. Not at all.",
	"pes_castle_intro_line_c_02": "Taal and Rhya, guide my steps.",
	"pes_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_01": "He's here. I can smell him.",
	"pes_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_02": "That's a pong, and no mistake. I reckon we've found him.",
	"pes_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_03": "Throne room; maniac. The two often go together.",
	"pes_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_04": "Get a whiff of that! He's in there.",
	"pes_castle_vo_blockage_01": "Can we get through?",
	"pes_castle_vo_blockage_02": "Is there a way past all that?",
	"pes_castle_vo_blockage_03": "How do we get through that lot, then?",
	"pes_castle_vo_blockage_04": "Can't we go around? I'm open to suggestions.",
	"pes_castle_vo_blood_pool_01": "As if there ain't already enough blood around here.",
	"pes_castle_vo_blood_pool_02": "Funny taste in interior decorating, ain't it?",
	"pes_castle_vo_blood_pool_03": "Not exactly something I'd want in my house.",
	"pes_castle_vo_blood_pool_04": "Yeah, well... That fountain's certainly eye-catching.",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_01": "So that's the sorcerer sorted. What about his daemon?",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_02": "Killing the sorcerer ain't enough. We need to find his daemon.",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_03": "Sorcerer, dead. How about that daemon of his?",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_04": "Now all we have to do is find his daemon and give it the same treatment.",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_01": "I feel like we're leaving something undone.",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_02": "Have we missed something, mates?",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_03": "I've got this niggling feeling... Like we've forgotten something.",
	"pes_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_04": "Strange... Why do I feel like we're not done?",
	"pes_castle_vo_door_open_01": "Reminds me of the time that recruiting sergeant gave me a drink with a shilling at the bottom of it.",
	"pes_castle_vo_door_open_02": "At least we don't have to break in.",
	"pes_castle_vo_door_open_03": "So they're making it easy for us? I don't like it.",
	"pes_castle_vo_door_open_04": "Anyone else feel a cold chill?",
	"pes_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_01": "This is the same, but it's different too.",
	"pes_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_02": "This is sort of familiar, but it's changed.",
	"pes_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_03": "This place sets my head spinning.",
	"pes_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_04": "We've been here... Or have we?",
	"pes_castle_vo_drop_down_01": "Down again? ",
	"pes_castle_vo_drop_down_02": "I remember when we had lifting platforms to take us places… That was good.",
	"pes_castle_vo_drop_down_03": "A hole in the floor? Really?",
	"pes_castle_vo_drop_down_04": "Let's hope there's no spikes at the bottom, eh?",
	"pes_castle_vo_enter_01": "That door looks promising.",
	"pes_castle_vo_enter_02": "How about that door? Looks like our only way through.",
	"pes_castle_vo_enter_03": "Not many options, other than that door.",
	"pes_castle_vo_enter_04": "Looks like it's that door, or nothing.",
	"pes_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_01": "Right. How do we get back upstairs?",
	"pes_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_02": "I'm not one to complain, but this ain't the castle.",
	"pes_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_03": "So, how do we get back up there?",
	"pes_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_04": "We'll have to find our way back up again, mates.",
	"pes_castle_vo_halls_01": "Looks like we're back in the castle.",
	"pes_castle_vo_halls_02": "The castle again? Right, let's be more careful this time.",
	"pes_castle_vo_halls_03": "Seems we're in the right place again.",
	"pes_castle_vo_halls_04": "Here we go... Back in the castle!",
	"pes_castle_vo_hello_01": "Where is everyone?",
	"pes_castle_vo_hello_02": "Here I am, spoiling for a fight and then... nothing.",
	"pes_castle_vo_hello_03": "Well that's rude. Where's our host?",
	"pes_castle_vo_hello_04": "Quiet, ain't it?",
	"pes_castle_vo_landed_01": "Let's... ow!... not do that again.",
	"pes_castle_vo_landed_02": "Oh, my aching bones...",
	"pes_castle_vo_landed_03": "Right in the coccyx. Always a favourite.",
	"pes_castle_vo_landed_04": "Should've seen that one coming.",

	"pes_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_03": "Yeah? Tell someone who cares.",

	"pes_castle_vo_recognize_03": "This all looks familiar. Think I got stabbed just over there.",
	"pes_castle_vo_recognize_04": "Nearly lost a finger in that corner. Good times.",
	"pes_castle_vo_search_again_01": "So, where's that sorcerer hiding?",
	"pes_castle_vo_search_again_02": "That sorcerer can't hide forever, mates.",

	"pes_castle_vo_secret_door_02": "Never even guessed that was there, if I'm honest.",

	"pes_castle_vo_secret_door_04": "Wonder where that leads?",
	"pes_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_01": "Well, we made a mess of him.",
	"pes_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_02": "Looks like the throne's empty again. Any takers? Mates? Mates?",
	"pes_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_03": "No good comes of claiming Drachenfels' throne - at least while we're around.",
	"pes_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_04": "Word of advice. Never call yourself 'Eternal' or 'Immortal'. It's just asking for trouble.",
	"pes_castle_vo_this_way_01": "Are we doing this, or what?",
	"pes_castle_vo_this_way_02": "Come on, mates. I'm bored.",

	"pes_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_03": "Isn't this the way to the throne room? Can't hurt to look in there.",
	"pes_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_04": "Maybe it's worth checking out the throne room? It's not far.",

	"pes_castle_vo_vista_01": "Kind of... pretty, isn't it?",

	"pes_cemetary_intro_c_01": "Aye, the dead deserve peace. Not rat-kin scratting about around their graves.",
	"pes_cemetary_intro_c_02": "It's going to be tight amongst them tombs, easy to get trapped.",

	"pes_chaos_war_camp_challenge_reply_c_02": "Can't talk you out of this, can I? FINE! WE'LL FIGHT!",
	"pes_chaos_war_camp_intro_a_01": "Walking into a northlander camp and killing their champion. Lohner made it sound as easy as making breakfast.",

	"pes_chaos_war_camp_intro_b_01": "I'm just pleased with how furious we've made this git.",
	"pes_chaos_war_camp_intro_b_02": "You're a barrel of laughs today, ain't you? Focus on the positives, like, no crowds in the camp?",
	"pes_chaos_war_camp_intro_c_01": "Aye, it's another day at work, folks. Let's get to the killing.",

	"pes_chaos_war_camp_taunt_payback_reply_04": "Listen, mate, we're busy killing your kin everyday, so I can't say for sure, but it does ring a bell. That Ghûlmagak a friend of yours. perhaps?",
	"pes_chaos_war_camp_taunt_payback_reply_04b": "Listen, mate, we're busy killing your kin everyday, so I can't say for sure, but it does ring a bell. That Ghûlmagak a friend of yours. perhaps?",
	"pes_cog_conversation_eighteen_01": "I don't get why some dwarfs are so suspicious of you engineers, Bardin.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_eighteen_02": "Yeah, but sometimes change is practical. Necessary, even.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_fifteen_01": "Met a dwarf engineer once. At the Battle of Hel Fenn. Cantankerous sort, he was.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_fifteen_02": "Not the famous one. The eighth, I think. They don't like to number them in case it encourages the vampires.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_fourteen_01": "Oi, Bardin! You wouldn't mind taking a look at the action on my repeating handgun, it's sticking something fierce.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_fourteen_02": "I thought you engineers loved fixing things ... Muttering about how the rest of us mistreat them?",
	"pes_cog_conversation_seventeen_01": "You always been interested in the engineer's trade, Bardin?",
	"pes_cog_conversation_seventeen_02": "It's funny, I don't think I can imagine you any shorter. Or without a beard.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_sixteen_01": "Reckon you could teach with the engineer's trade? I've always been good with my hands.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_sixteen_02": "Mostly ... Yeah. Yeah, I reckon am.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_thirteen_01": "So, I guess we can expect to see a few dwarfen upgrades around here?",
	"pes_cog_conversation_thirteen_02": "You sound like Catrinne. Eating all those paintbrushes has obviously had an effect.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_thirtythree_01": "You and all, Bardin. Dapper threads never hurt anyone, did they?",
	"pes_cog_conversation_twentyfive_01": "Yeah. Wretched thing won't open unless you pull the right combination of levers. And there are a lot of levers.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_twentyfive_02": "Yeah! In engineer's code-runes. Who reads that?",
	"pes_cog_conversation_twentysix_01": "Don't be like that. We're a team.",
	"pes_cog_conversation_twentysix_02": "Wait ... What?",
	"pes_cog_trailer_01": "You ready? We’re leaving now!",
	"pes_comet_conversation_five_01": "Yeah. Fun times, dead ahead.",
	"pes_comet_conversation_five_02": "Showed up early, didn't it? Now I lose me bet!",
	"pes_comet_conversation_nine_01": "Yeah, I'm sure it'll make all the difference.",
	"pes_comet_conversation_nine_02": "Am I? How many times has the comet shown up over the years? How many times have things actually gotten better?",
	"pes_comet_conversation_one_01": "Reckon old Sigmar might actually pitch in?",
	"pes_comet_conversation_ten_01": "Better get up there, Saltzpyre. You know how she gets.",
	"pes_comet_conversation_ten_02": "Poor, deluded innocent.",
	"pes_crater_ambush_done_01": "Beastmen? Bloody beastmen? I thought those days were behind me.",
	"pes_crater_ambush_done_02": "Lost a whole bloody patrol to an ambush like that, back in the day. I should have known better.",
	"pes_crater_ambush_done_03": "Beastmen. I might have bloody known. They're never far away.",
	"pes_crater_ambush_done_04": "Now it's beastmen, is it? Not how I saw the day going. Not at all.",
	"pes_crater_ambush_interactable_01": "The plot thickens...",
	"pes_crater_ambush_interactable_02": "Mates? Do any of you remember slitting up a rat ogre since we arrived?",
	"pes_crater_ambush_interactable_03": "I don't like this... Feels wrong.",
	"pes_crater_ambush_interactable_04": "That's a mess. Take a look, but stay watchful.",
	"pes_crater_arena_end_01": "Who else lived through that. Anyone?",
	"pes_crater_arena_end_02": "Ow. Everything hurts. Why does the air smell like despair?",
	"pes_crater_arena_end_03": "Well, that was an experience. Never again, if you please.",
	"pes_crater_arena_end_04": "No glorious death today. Maybe tomorrow.",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_01": "There, mates! The standard! Smash it!",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_02": "The standard's the key, mates.",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_02_01": "And another! Break it down!",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_02_02": "We've got another to destroy!",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_02_03": "Standard number two! Don't hesitate!",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_02_04": "And... another standard to smash!",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_03": "Someone destroy that filthy standard!",
	"pes_crater_arena_standard_04": "The standard's crackling with magic!",
	"pes_crater_arena_waystone_01": "Let's head off. There's nothing left around here.",
	"pes_crater_arena_waystone_02": "I need a kip and a drink after that lot.",
	"pes_crater_arena_waystone_03": "My head's fair ringing. I need some peace and quiet.",
	"pes_crater_arena_waystone_04": "There's the portal. Thank you, Mistress Olesya.",
	"pes_crater_bridge_sighted_01": "Tree bridge? Not ideal, but it'll work.",
	"pes_crater_bridge_sighted_02": "There's a tree spanning the chasm down there.",
	"pes_crater_bridge_sighted_03": "See over there? That tree crosses the chasm.",
	"pes_crater_bridge_sighted_04": "There's a fallen tree over there. Might help us cross.",
	"pes_crater_climb_top_01": "Hello. I think we're getting somewhere.. That ain't exactly a hymn to Sigmar, is it?",
	"pes_crater_climb_top_02": "Guttural voices, sense of impending doom, funny smell to the air. I think we're getting close.",
	"pes_crater_climb_top_03": "No doubt about it, we're getting closer. Hear that chanting? ",
	"pes_crater_climb_top_04": "We've only stumbled onto a bloody ritual, haven't we? Lucky bloody us.",
	"pes_crater_conversation_eight_02": "That ain't funny. They're different as witch and wizard. Taal's all about the cycle of life, the purity of the hunt. Beastmen? Ain't no purity in them. Just corruption.",
	"pes_crater_conversation_four_01": "Ever have any trouble with beastmen before, Bardin?",
	"pes_crater_conversation_four_02": "Now, now. Let's not make a contest of this. We're all on the same side.",
	"pes_crater_conversation_one_01": "Beastmen. That takes me back...",
	"pes_crater_conversation_one_02": "Not in the cities, behind nice stone walls. This blasted wilderness is another matter.",
	"pes_crater_conversation_one_03": "If you say so.",
	"pes_crater_conversation_ten_01": "So the others'll think I'm a witch hunter?",
	"pes_crater_conversation_ten_02": "Gotta be honest, not sure what to say about that, sir.",
	"pes_crater_devastation_01": "What a bloody mess this is. Still, best foot forward. Let's get where we're going.",
	"pes_crater_devastation_02": "Met a soothsayer a while back. He said the sky would send my death. Wonder if he meant something like this.",
	"pes_crater_devastation_03": "Taal, but this is horrible. Can't defend against this sort of thing, can you?",
	"pes_crater_devastation_04": "Let's hurry up and get this done. This whole place gives me the shivers.",
	"pes_crater_forest_ascent_top_01": "Keep moving! There'll be answers once we get through the mountain.",
	"pes_crater_forest_ascent_top_02": "Still no end of them. Keep searching for a way through. We're still on the wrong side of this hill.",
	"pes_crater_forest_ascent_top_03": "We'll have to find a way through. If Lohner's right, we're still on the wrong side.",
	"pes_crater_forest_ascent_top_04": "I don't want to climb over this lot if we can help it. Maybe there's a way through to the crater?",
	"pes_crater_intro_banter_a_01": "Well, always good to stretch the old legs, see new places.",
	"pes_crater_intro_banter_a_02": "Here we are. Come a long way to see this... whatever it is.",
	"pes_crater_intro_banter_b_01": "Now, it's not like Lohner's ever steered us wrong before... well, not often.",
	"pes_crater_intro_banter_b_02": "If Lohner's worried, I reckon the rest of us should be too.",
	"pes_crater_intro_banter_c_01": "Well, better get moving. Won't find anything standing around nattering, will we?",
	"pes_crater_intro_banter_c_02": "We'd best have a look. Who knows... maybe there ain't a problem this time.",
	"pes_crater_plan_banter_a_01": "We can't let this stand! We're the bloody Ubersreik Five! (sort of). Can't we, I don't know, disrupt the ritual, and then...",
	"pes_crater_plan_banter_a_02": "Come on mates, I'm not exactly the brains of this operation, but can't we disrupt the ritual, might be that...",
	"pes_crater_plan_banter_b_01": "...we throw the warpstone for a loop, maybe even polish it off. And the beastmen too. And, of course...",
	"pes_crater_plan_banter_b_02": "...the warpstone goes a bit unhappy? Don't look at me like that, I've read the pictures in books. Might get a bit ticklish for us, of course...",
	"pes_crater_plan_banter_c_01": "...Join the army, they said. One big adventure and a shiny uniform. Well, I've certainly had that. Death and glory it is!",
	"pes_crater_plan_banter_c_02": "...Well, never let it be said that Mother Kruber's favourite son ever shirked certain death! I'm in.",
	"pes_crater_rim_vista_01": "Ah... Mates? I don't know that we can do anything about that much warpstone...",
	"pes_crater_rim_vista_02": "That's a lot more warpstone than I expected. Too big to smash, and its making my skin itch just to look at it.",
	"pes_crater_rim_vista_03": "Mates? Seems we've more warpstone than is healthy to touch. What in Taal's name do we do now?",
	"pes_crater_rim_vista_04": "That's a lot of warpstone. Too much, in fact. Taal and Rhya, but I'm not sure how we sort this one out.",
	"pes_crater_tracking_camp_01": "So what's this then? Skaven, maybe? Buggers never leave us alone.",
	"pes_crater_tracking_camp_02": "Looks like a ratmen problem. Again.",
	"pes_crater_tracking_camp_03": "Rat, rats, rats. Everywhere we go, bloody rats.",
	"pes_crater_tracking_camp_04": "Someone did a number on this, didn't they? Keep your eyes open.",
	"pes_crater_vista_reveal_01": "Taal and bloody Rhya! That's a mess, ain't it?",
	"pes_crater_vista_reveal_02": "I guess we know the reason for those rumours now. And it was looking like such a nice day and all.",
	"pes_crater_vista_reveal_03": "So that's what's had old Lohner worried? Feeling a bit peaky myself, truth be told.",
	"pes_crater_vista_reveal_04": "A magical vortex, is that? Just another Aubentag for us, surely?",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_intro_01": "There were folk lived down there, mates. Now a bloody warpstone meteor's walloped them all. We'd better do something.",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_intro_02": "Can't leave a chunk of warpstone in beastman hands, can we? 'Cause if it's not them, it'll be the skaven.",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_intro_03": "Warpstone meteors? Never signed up for that. (sigh) Still, we're here now. Let's see what can be done.",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_intro_04": "A warpstone meteor, I reckon. Don't look at me like that. I've travelled. We'd better do something about it.",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_tree_push_01": "Give that tree a tap, mates. It'll serve.",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_tree_push_02": "Topple that tree, and we'll be across.",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_tree_push_03": "What about that tree? Will it move?",
	"pes_crater_wasteland_tree_push_04": "How about that tree, mates?",
	"pes_crawl_cheers_01": "For Taal, Rhya and bloody Ranald! Yes!",
	"pes_crawl_cheers_02": "Have a quaff, wake the bloody gryphon and damn them all! ",
	"pes_crawl_cheers_03": "Who wants to wrestle? I'll take you all on!",
	"pes_crawl_cheers_04": "Oh yes! With brew like this, the Empire'll never bloody fall! You'll see!",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_five_01": "The Orc and Feather? You make too much of that. Those girls were just friendly, that's all.",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_five_02": "And I still say it might have been worth it.",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_four_01": "Never took you for a drinker, Kerillian.",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_four_02": "Sure you are. Then so was Bardin the time he drank the Red Moon's cellar dry.",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_one_01": "Is that right, sir? Had a particular career in mind?",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_one_02": "Sounds lovely. Oi, maybe there's a wheelbarrow we could borrow?",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_three_01": "Ain't been properly sober in twenty years, Sienna. Helps me forget. And I'll tell you another thing...",
	"pes_crawl_conversation_three_02": "It helps me forget.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_01": "Oh yeah, that's the bloody stuff!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_02": "Let me at 'em!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_03": "Oh sweet ale, let's get killing!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_04": "Strong as stout! Yeah!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_05": "Come and get me!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_06": "That's the drop! (laugh)",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_01": "Ah, be still my heaving stomach.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_02": "Nothing like the hair of the dog.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_03": "That was a hairy old dog, but it's doing me good.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_04": "Ale-given strength, returning! Ya-hah!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_05": "Stomach... settling. Killer rage... rising (laugh)",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_begins_from_sick_06": "Just give me a moment, will you? I'm getting there.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_01": "Ale-given strength... fading...",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_02": "Feeling... sleepy...",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_03": "YAWN",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_04": "A DIFFERENT YAWN",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_05": "Kruber needs ale, badly.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_06": "Someone find me a bloody drink!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_07": "Give your old mate Kruber a drink, would you?",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_buff_wears_off_08": "I need a bloody drink! Now!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_01": "I see you!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_02": "Come on then, if you think you're... What was I saying?",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_03": "Come out and fight, you bleeders!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_incoming_threat_04": "No. No. I'm not fighting that one. Not until someone apologises.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_01": "No! Not the ground! It always wins!",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_02": "Can anyone give a fellow a hand, mates?",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_03": "Face first in shit, again.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_knocked_down_04": "Oi! Over here! Hello?",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_01": "That's my drink. Find yer own.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_02": "Something to drink?",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_03": "That's my ale, not yours.",
	"pes_crawl_drunk_spotted_liquid_04": "Is that an ale?",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_01": "Is that Bugman's? Now that's a result!",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_02": "Grab that cask! One does not simply walk out on a stash of Bugman's.",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_03": "Oi, mates. We're not gonna leave that Bugman's around for someone else to pinch are we?",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_find_good_beer_04": "Grab that cask of Bugman's! That's a bloody order!",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_keep_quiet_01": "Quiet mates. Can't have an ale with them bawling for our heads.",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_keep_quiet_02": "Softly, soft-ly. Keep it down, and we'll have our drink.",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_keep_running_01": "Double-time it, mates! That's right!",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_keep_running_02": "Hah! You'll never catch fleet-footed Kruber!",
	"pes_crawl_end_event_keep_running_03": "Don't look back! Just keep running!",

	"pes_crawl_pub_horde_end_03": "Whew! I'm out of breath. Might need a bit of a guzzle to get me strength back.",
	"pes_crawl_pub_horde_end_04": "Another triumph for proud Kruber and his best mates.",
	"pes_crawl_shortcut_01": "As our master <hic> strategist, I recommend we go through the park.",

	"pes_crawl_shortcut_03": "Are we all blind? Come on - through the park!",
	"pes_crawl_shortcut_04": "Quick march! Through the park! I don't want to get there and find all the ale gone!",
	"pes_crawl_slaughter_01": "Attacking folk who're having a quiet drink? Monsters! Barbarians! ",

	"pes_crawl_slaughter_04": "What a bleedin' mess. Still, can't do much for them now.",
	"pes_crawl_spot_first_pub_01": "There it is! Lovely! I can taste the ale already!",
	"pes_crawl_spot_first_pub_02": "Can't beat a dwarf tavern for a bit of brew.",

	"pes_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_03": "Just a bit further... Just a few complications to work around.",
	"pes_crawl_spot_first_pub_closer_04": "Don't lose spirits now, mates. On we go...",
	"pes_crawl_spot_second_pub_01": "See, I told the landlord that his pet phoenix was a danger, but he wouldn't listen. Oh, no",
	"pes_crawl_spot_second_pub_02": "Now that's a real tragedy. I could weep.",
	"pes_crawl_spot_second_pub_03": "You know, I can't help thinking it looked a bit different last time I was here...",
	"pes_crawl_spot_second_pub_04": "Can't sup ashes, can we? Bloody hellfire and soggy bread!",
	"pes_crawl_spot_third_pub_01": "The Obese Megalodon, and the only bloody megalodon I hope to every bloody see!",
	"pes_crawl_spot_third_pub_02": "The Obese Megalodon. Our one and true saviour in these parched hours.",
	"pes_crawl_spot_third_pub_03": "There we go. The Obese Megalodon!",

	"pes_crawl_tunnel_passage_04": "Just along here, mates. Keep together and salivate at the prospect of a good pint!",
	"pes_crawl_upstairs_01": "We been upstairs yet?",

	"pes_fleur_conversation_eighteen_01": "Never guessed. Still, it's a rum old family that doesn't have secrets, ain't it?",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_eighteen_02": "I wouldn't worry. I don't suppose there's much of it left. Something about vengeful elves.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_eight_01": "What? You reckon someone cares that much about this whole Grail knight thing?",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_eight_02": "Wouldn't know. Anyway, I stole most of 'em in the first place.",

	"pes_fleur_conversation_sixteen_01": "Yeah, well don't expect me to start spouting poetry.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_sixteen_02": "Give it a rest. I've gotta get the accent right first, and Kerillian sniggers every time I try.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_six_01": "Way I see it, ain't much has changed. It's all killing, ain't it?",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_six_02": "Soft? Me? Don't talk daft.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_ten_01": "Very well, peasant. Speak.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_ten_02": "What accent? Anyway, what did you want?",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_thirteen_01": "Yeah, well, some of us are meant for great things, Sienna.",

	"pes_fleur_conversation_twelve_01": "Real as you and me. And beautiful. Of course, I had been drinking.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_twelve_02": "Couldn't rightly say. Like I said, I had been drinking.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_twenty_01": "Me? Nah. 'Course, the rest of you'll have to shape up a bit. Standards, and all.",
	"pes_fleur_conversation_twenty_02": "Oi! Nothing wrong with that dagger. Killed a lot of men with it, I have.",

That's right, finding a way to wreck the bloody thing before it goes and makes matters worse. I'll have help, of course. The Ubersreik Five rides again. Well, walks. Doesn't sounds as good though, does it?",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_bell_02": "I've had better days. Lohner's making jokes about pumpkins, and the skaven have rigged one of their cursed bells up in the centre of Helmgart. It'll have to go, and we're the fellows to get the job done, but my ears were ringing for weeks after the last one. At least I won't be able to hear Lohner's gourd-based obsessions for a while.",

	"pes_gk_loading_screen_catacombs_02": "Well, Helmgart's seen better days, but at least the Shallyan Hospice was a safe haven for the sick. At least, it was. Now there are folk disappearing right out of their beds, and that's just impolite. Lohner, being a man of good sense, reckons we should take a little walk and see if we can find someone to discourage. Seems like a plan.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_cemetary_01": "There's something funny in the water, and it's not the usual dead dogs and drunks. The ratmen are up to their little tricks out in Morr's Field, and if we don't put a stop to it before the ale runs out it's gonna be trouble for everyone.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_cemetary_02": "Ratmen do love their poisons, and right now Ubersreik's got enough troubles without wondering why the water's a strange shade of bowel-loosening green. According to Lohner, the problem starts out in Morr's Field. That sounds about right, but blow me if I can work out why...",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01": "Apparently, we've drawn a bit too much attention. There's a Rotblood champion camped out in the marshes set on finding the keep and burying us all beneath it. Can't say I'm fond of that idea, myself. Nor are the the others, so this Bödvarr Ribspreader's about to have a very bad day. Maybe even the worst, if Bardin starts singing at him.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02": "Bödvarr Ribspreader. Sounds like a nice lad, if a bit lacking in the social graces. Then again, what do you expect of a Rotblood champion? He and his mates are camped out in the marshes - more bloody marshes, I ask you - and we're to pay him a bit of a visit and ask him to pack in his nonsense. Well, I say 'ask', but as we've established, social graces don't go far with his sort.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_crawl_01": "We've hit a lull, and Lohner's kicked us all out of the keep so we can grab a quiet drink. A quiet drink? One sniff of a good brandy and Saltzpyre starts chuffing and whistling. Still, I suppose Helmgart's had worse lately, and I do have a powerful thirst...",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_crawl_02": "It's gone quiet. We're all surprised. Saltzpyre almost smiled, and if that ain't a sign of strange times, I don't know what is. Lohner's suggested we wander into what's left of Helmgart and have a quiet drink. Well, don't let it be said that Mother Kruber's favourite son never answered the call.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01": "Lohner was right about Bögenhafen. There's a Chaos runesword at the root of it, and a real nasty one too. Lucky for us, Father Kraussman has it sealed away, and all we've got to do is get it off him. Turns out Kraussman's an old friend of Saltzpyre's - one he hasn't seen in years - so I'm sure that'll work out just fine.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02": "Seems our Bögenhafen problem centers on a corrupted runesword, forged by a mad dwarf… well, a slightly madder-than-normal dwarf, leastways. The Blightreaper, it's called, and one Father Kraussman has it locked away just waiting for us to take it off his hands. Yeah, right. When is it ever that easy for the Ubersreik Five?",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01": "Join the army, see the world. They never said anything about seeing the nice parts, did they? Bloody fine print. Take Bögenhafen. It's more swamp than city, which is probably why it's crawling with plague. Not that Lohner listens to me, of course. As usual, he blames the Rotbloods. Worst of it is, he's probably right. I hate it when he's right.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02": "Bögenhafen. That takes me back - but don't ask me why, or I'll have to kill you and that'd make me sad. There's plague in the town right now, but Lohner thinks there's more to it than that. And when Lohner gets an itchy feeling, I get to sharpening my weapons. Not sure what we're getting into with this one, but there's bound to be a fight.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01": "For the last couple of days, Olesya's been moaning that the Bridge of Shadows ain't working right. Luckily for the rest of us - she does have a good pair of lungs on her - she's narrowed down the source of the disruption to an old elven temple. Probably dangerous. Might get killed. But that's better than sticking around here when Olesya's in a mood.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02": "Olesya's getting interference in the Winds of Magic - whatever that means - and says it's centred on the temple of Athel Yenlui - whatever that is. It's bound to be the Rotbloods. Leastways, I hope so. If it's a mob of elven mages all off their heads on mushroom wine, then I'll leave Kerillian too it. One angry elf per Kruber, that's the strict limit.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_farmland_01": "Plenty of good farmland around here. Problem is, the Rotbloods know it too. They're got raiding parties out, snatching whatever grain they can lay their filthy hands on, and plenty of farmers too. Can't be Chaos-worshipping scum without a good ritual, can you? Well, we're gonna get the poor buggers back, whatever takes.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_farmland_02": "We've got Rotbloods pillaging the farms around Ussingen. Worse than that, the useless bloody civvies refused to scarper at the first smoke column over their fields and got nabbed. Wouldn't want their life expectancy right now, even with the bloody Ubersreik Five coming to the rescue. Which of course we bloody are. That's the bloody job.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01": "Seems the skaven are busy building war machines out in the forest, and it's up to us to smash 'em to pieces. I'm not saying I don't like the idea, but it does all seem a bit familiar. I've got to stop eating that cheese before bed. Anything Bardin keeps beneath the helmet of his can't be good for you.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02": "Wandering around the forest, looking for skaven war machines? You ever get that feeling there's an echo in your life? Worse part is, every time I think I know what's going on, the feeling slips away. Best to take in out on the ratmen. The vicious little buggers have it coming.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_fort_01": "Saltzpyre doesn't trust Olesya's portals, but I bloody love 'em. It'd take days to get up to Fort Brachsenbrücke by cart, and the bloody fortress will have fallen by then. This way we should get there before that happens - assuming we can find this back way in that Lohner's so keen on. After that, we'll see. I do hope it involves killing. I'm good at that.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_fort_02": "Fort Brachsenbrücke's in trouble. Of course, it's always in trouble, what with its castellan being drunk half the time, and asleep the other half. But now they've got a Pactsworn problem as well. If the fortress folds, that'll be it for half of the Reikland, and would you believe it's the half I actually like? Can't have that.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_ground_zero_01": "If things weren't already bad enough in Helmgart, there's a sorcerer conjuring - and I quote - a mist so poisonous it'll make your blood rot in your veins. So naturally, Lohner's sending us right into the thick of it. He's a good sort, but would it kill him to get out in the field once in a while? Right. Better get this done. Have to set an example for the others, don't I?",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_ground_zero_02": "There's a sorcerer causing trouble down in Helmgart. Can't remember his name - I'm pretty sure Lohner makes these things up, anyway. Whatever the bugger calls himself, apparently he's whipping up a toxic mist to drown the whole city. Which means me and mine get to play 'hide the pointy implement' with his rotten hide until he takes 'no' for an answer.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01": "Apparently, Olesya's sneaking around looking for the Skittergate - which suits me fine, 'cos it means she's not looking for *me*. Only, she needs a distraction to get the job done. I told Lohner the Old Biddy's quite distracting enough, but I don't think he heard me, so the rest of us are off to ring the bells in the Temple of Sigmar.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02": "Lohner wants a distraction, and apparently getting Saltzpyre drunk on brandy and setting him loose in the marketplace just ain't gonna cut it. So we're heading up to the Temple of Sigmar to set the bells ringing. Course, there's every chance the skaven have got there first, so I'm still hoping someone wants to go with the brandy plan. I'll talk to Kerillian. She might be up for it.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01": "Some homecoming this is: stuck in Ubersreik just as the skaven decide it's the perfect holiday spot. But the city won't fall without a fight… at least, if there's a warning. So it's off to Magnus Tower with this peculiar lot to raise the alarm. They're an odd bunch, but I get the feeling it's all gonna work out...",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02": "Looks like we're off to Magnus Tower to sound the alarm and warn Ubersreik that the skaven ain't gonna take 'no' for an answer. Ain't gonna lie, this don't look good… but that's not even the worst part. I've got a funny feeling that I've done all this before. It's weird. I either need to stop drinking, or drink more.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_mines_01": "Turns out the Rotbloods' bile trolls ain't nothing natural, but some kind of sorcerous perversion. I think it was the word 'perversion' that got Saltzpyre interested, because now we're off to the Dreisdunkel Mines to see if we can put an end to the business. Bloody hate trolls. They smell worse than Bardin, and die twice as hard.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_mines_02": "Trolls? Who breeds Trolls? I mean, there was this one village out in Ostland where everyone looked a bit warty, but that was the plague. I think. Never did find out who burned it down. That aside, seems the Rotbloods are taking a bunch of your common or garden trolls and twisting 'em something rotten. That ain't good for the Reikland, so we're off to Dreisdunkel Mine to put a stop to it.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_nurgle_01": "Olesya reckons the Rotbloods are digging some kind of ancient monolith out of the swamp. Leave 'em to it, says I, but Lohner and Saltzpyre do so enjoy making things difficult for the rest of us, so we're off to get the bloody thing reburied. It's mud, death and rats for lucky old Kruber - and wet feet too, I shouldn't wonder. Still, can't complain.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_nurgle_02": "Kruber's Rule Number One for a Happy Life: don't go messing with ghastly ancient monoliths. Seems the Rotbloods haven't got the message, as they're digging one out of the swamp as we speak. Guess who's drawn the task of getting the bloody thing reburied? I get all the nice jobs. Still, at least it'll get me away from Olesya... that woman keeps giving me funny looks.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01": "Off we go again. This time, down into the caves of Karak Gnol to giving a ratman warlord a fatal kicking. Who says nice things don't happen to nice people? Hasn't been a dwarf down there for ages, worse luck, and the halls are infested with skaven. Still, it'll be nice to be going after the boss for a change. Officers are all the same pointy ears and twitching tails or no...",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02": "It's a good life, if you don't weaken. Today, it seems, I'm an assassin. Won't be the first time, and probably not the last. The target? The skaven warlord camped down in Karak Gnol. We're to sneak in, give him a Tilean handshake, and sneak back out again. Lohner's promised payments in pumpkins again. That man's got a thing about pumpkins. It ain't healthy.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_skittergate_01": "Lohner reckons the Skittergate's as unguarded as it's gonna get, so guess where poor bloody Kruber and his merry maniacs are off to next? Gotta be honest, I ain't looking forward to this one. Ain't enough to wreck it from this end, you see. We've got to ride the bloody contraption to the frozen bloody north and put the boot in from there. I need a drink...",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_skittergate_02": "Right. This could be a ticklish one. No two ways about it - that Skittergate's got to go down, and there's no one else to do the job. Problem is, we can't do it from the Helmgate side. We'll have to travel to the frozen north and give it a thumping from that end, too. Lohner reckons it'll work, but you'll notice that he's staying home for this one...",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_ussingen_01": "Rotbloods have sacked Ussingen and turned the Baron's manor into a storehouse. Now, you know how an army marches on its stomach - those that don't march on rotgut brandy and soured ale, leastways - well, it's true of the northlanders as well. So we're gonna blow up the manor, supplies and all. Fun times.",
	"pes_gk_loading_screen_ussingen_02": "Looks like Ussingen's had it. The town's proper ruined, but we've still got a chance to even the score. Them Rotbloods have been filling the Baron's manor with all the grain they can steal - which is a lot - so we're gonna blow the bloody thing to pieces. Won't bring back the dead, but no good ever comes from doing that anyhow, does it?",

	"pes_gk_portals_briefing_01": "Lohner's breaking out the pumpkin jokes again, so you know it's bad. The Pactsworn are kidnapping folk in the shadow of Castle Drachenfels, and it's down to us to put things right. Can't say I'm keen risking my neck up there again - bloody lucky to get out last time, if you ask me - but that's the soldier's life, ain't it?",
	"pes_gk_portals_briefing_02": "The Pactsworn are camped out in Castle Drachenfels and making trouble in the villages below. Bad news for everyone, especially if one or two of the nastier myths are true. So my thinking is we'd better make this fast. Lucky for us, we've got killing Rotbloods and ratmen down to a fine art. But you know what they say about practice making perfect.",
	"pes_gk_woods_conversation_one_01": "I guess you and me are even more on the same side, these days. You know, Bretonnia and Athel Loren. The Old Alliance.",

	"pes_gk_woods_conversation_two_01": "That crack you made before ... About the painless death. Not gonna lie ... it hurt my feelings.",

	"pes_ground_zero_intro_a_01": "Quiet enough walk this far, mates. The pact bastards are late for the party.",
	"pes_ground_zero_intro_a_02": "We're getting close mates. Shouldn't we be fighting hordes of pact-pissers by now?",
	"pes_ground_zero_intro_b_01": "Just close up, and don't get separated. They'll be over us before you know it..",
	"pes_ground_zero_intro_b_02": "Impatient today, eh? I'd offer a rousing chorus of something, but I reckon it'd only make things worse.",
	"pes_ground_zero_intro_c_01": "Righto, mates, we've a sodding sorcerer to off. Good deed of the day and a bit of fun, all in one.",
	"pes_ground_zero_intro_c_02": "Well, we've still a sorcerer to have a friendly, stabby chat with. Bring your gift of the gab, mates. And your gift of the stab.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_intro_a_01": "Time for a distraction. Are we ready?",
	"pes_helmgart_military_intro_a_02": "We'll make for a fine distraction. Don't we always?",
	"pes_helmgart_military_intro_b_01": "I'm glad to pitch in. Don't fancy this tromp across the wall, though. Might get a bit blowy.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_intro_b_02": "We're the best Lohner had at hand. Always will be, most likely.",

	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_a_01": "Still not rightly sure what Lohner wants hidden from the enemy.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_a_02": "Did Lohner say anything to you about the 'why' of all this?",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_b_01": "The crone's spying, so Lohner told me. They want to know more about the Skittergate.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_b_02": "The crone wanted a look at the Skittergate. Easier if the Skaven are looking at us.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_c_01": "Keeps her away from me, at least.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_c_02": "Maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe the ratmen'll kill her.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_a_01": "I see Okri wants us to clobber something. Again.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_a_02": "Hmmm. Okri's got another of these grudgemarks for us to settle.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_b_01": "Long as he's paying, what's the harm?",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_b_02": "It's a laugh, ain't it? May as well do something to pass the time.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_c_01": "Okri might have sweetened the deal with some dwarfen ale.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_c_02": "Too much to ask that Okri lends a hand, I suppose.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_kn_one_02": "Ah, knock it off Lohner. Just cause I was tapped on me shoulders with a sword, by Saltzpyre of all people, I'm not changing who I am over night. Bloody good gear though. Can't complain about that.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_kn_three_02": "No! You shall not. And you don't need to be 'sir'-ing me all the time either. And yeah, sounds like you're more interested in finding this old Grandmaster than I am.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_kn_two_02": "Mhh. Apparently, no survivors except for a geriatric old grandmaster somewhere. Poor sods. Never had the chance to meet a single one of them.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_twentyfive_01": "Taal! I asked you to keep that woman away from me!",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_twentyfour_01": "Yeah, well... Not yet. Bit busy for the foreseeable, ain't we?",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_twentyone_01": "They'll do fine, long as they keep their heads.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_twentythree_01": "Already did. They'll hold, provided we don't draw too much ire.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_twentytwo_01": "Ain't a game playing against you. Do you ever lose a hand?",
	"pes_hub_olesya_conversation_twentyfive_01": "Same as most days, I'd have thought, Madame Pimenova.",

	"pes_level_bell_falling_02": "Hah! That bell didn't feel like going out with simply a 'BONG' did it? Good times!",
	"pes_level_bell_falling_03": "Now - that - is leaving a mark and making an impression, mates! Worth the march, definitely!",
	"pes_level_bell_falling_04": "Bell's down. Now, if it'd only stop making that racket!",
	"pes_level_bell_horde_01": "There's a surge of 'em every time that thing makes a racket.",

	"pes_level_bell_horde_03": "Shutting that bell up will definitely mean less vermin hordes. Figure some of you may find that a bit boring.",

	"pes_level_bell_rich_quarters_03": "Always wanted to afford a little abode like one of these. And only afford. Not a city-dweller, me.",

	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_01": "Poor bugger. Didn't run far enough.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_02": "Looks like he tried to make a run for it. Didn't do him much good.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_03": "Didn't get far, did he? Bloody northlanders.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_04": "Well, we've no shortage of priests. It's the keys I'm worried about.",

	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_02": "Sigmar's not here, not any more. Nurgle's got his claws into the place.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_03": "Filth everywhere. Tendrils everywhere. Bloody disgrace.",

	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_03": "Looks like an escapee from Malthusius' Freakshow...",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_04": "What a bleedin' shame. Those bones are all that's left of a freakshow celebrity, unless I miss my guess.",

	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_04": "Ambush! Form up! Form up!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_01": "Yeah. So that's a mess. The corruption's spreading.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_02": "Looks like we were right about this starting amongst the wealthy.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_03": "Look at that! Grandfather Nurgle's got a grip on this place, and how!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_04": "Take a gander over there. Don't reckon those tendrils are a Bögenhafen delicacy.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_01": "Never heard of a sword spreading plague before.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_02": "All this pestilence? From a sword. Beggars belief, it does.",

	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_03": "No wonder we've no help. The bloody Reiksmarshal could walk through here with a marching band and no one'd hear it over that lot.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_04": "Hark at all that. Taal knows what they're celebrating. I wish they'd look out of their windows.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_01": "Where's the switch?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_02": "Let's get crackin´ and find the switch.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_03": "Right, let's find these switch-contraptions.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_04": "Quick - find the switch!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_01": "Taal, give me this!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_02": "One more should do it.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_03": "Just one more.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_04": "We can do this!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_01": "Keep on it!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_02": "Onto the next one.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_03": "Good work, keep going.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_04": "By the Silver Hammer, next one.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_01": "Rhya! My feet are already soaked, now the rest of me's going the same way.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_02": "Well, I can't say I don't like the breeze, but I could do without the rain.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_03": "Wet through. Again. Top to bottom and inside out.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_04": "Bloody rain. Everything's chafing.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_01": "Nice to be in the warm, drinking and singing...",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_02": "We couldn't stop by, could we? Borrow a mug of brandy?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_03": "You sure we don't have time to grab a drink or two? Sounds like they've got plenty.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_04": "Cheery bunch, aren't they? Then again, they're indoors.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_01": "So where's this bloody sanctum?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_02": "It's one thing for Lohner to witter about levers, and another to find the blessed things.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_03": "Eyes open for hidden doors, mates. The sanctum's near.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_04": "The sanctum's hidden, so Lohner says. We'll have to find a way in.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_01": "Lotta readin' down here. Don't reckon I'd like most of what's written down.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_02": "Quite a collection. Don't think I'd want it in my home, mind.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_03": "Kraussman was a hoarder, weren't he? Looking more and more like a heretic and all.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_04": "Mouldy old tomes? Yeah, this is the place.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_01": "Oh that's just bloody beautiful! I've got wet feet already!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_02": "Soggy feet's no way to start a fight. I need new boots.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_03": "Reckon Olesya's been poking holes in my boots. Never say 'no' to a Kislevite.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_04": "My feet are soaked. Can we pop back? Didn't think so.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_01": "Well, that's another place we've left our mark, mates.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_02": "Look at that smoke! Won't be able to show my face around here after tonight.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_03": "The Ubersreik Five. What we don't blow up, we burn down. We'll get a reputation.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_04": "Bugger. The Ubersreik Five. If the ratmen haven't burnt your city up, we'll take care of it.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eight_01": "You ever make it to Bögenhafen before, sir?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eleven_01": "Did I hear that right? There are seven Chaos Runeswords?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eleven_02": "Blimey. Rotbloods and ratmen were bad enough. Don't want to fret about undead as well.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_five_01": "To think we reckoned this began in the slums. Goes to show, Lohner doesn't always know everything.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_nine_01": "Really? Why'd he give it up, sir?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_one_01": "Yes, can't have those dainty elf-feet getting wet, can we?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_one_02": "Soaked through and miserable, thanks for asking.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_six_01": "Ubersreik, Helmgart, Bögenhafen. Whole bloody Empire's falling into the soup.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_three_01": "I didn't know dwarfs worshipped the Dark Gods.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_story_three_02": "Makes you wonder what could make 'em turn evil like that.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_01": "We don't have time to take this slow, mates.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_02": "Liven it up! We don't have a lot of time on this one.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_03": "Hurry up, you lazy lot! Grandfather Nurgle ain't gonna ease up because we're all a bit tired.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_04": "Come on! We need to keep a bit of pace going. I don't want to have to sing a marching song, but I will.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_01": "Best head back, get that gate open.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_02": "Here we go, back to the temple.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_03": "Keep close. We're heading back to the temple.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_04": "Better get back to the temple. No telling what's waiting for us.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_01": "I fight better in torchlight than darkness. Don't know about you.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_02": "Don't leave that torch behind, yeah?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_03": "Grab that torch, someone.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_04": "We'll carry light with us. Just in case.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_01": "And we've even got us a way out. Lovely stuff.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_02": "Nice of them to make us a door, weren't it?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_03": "Never say the pact-sworn don't have their uses. We're good to move out!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_04": "They made a mess of the blockage. A bit of luck at last.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_01": "Can't fight a smell - but this lot? Bring 'em on!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_02": "Awright! Come on then!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_03": "Close up, mates! Let's give this lot a kicking!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_04": "Stay together! We're a team, remember?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_01": "We'll have to burn it all. Oh, don't look so cheery at the prospect.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_02": "Burn the lot of it. I can't see another way.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_03": "We're gonna need a little flame. Fire's a great leveller.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_04": "Burn it. Burn it all. Rotten filthy stuff.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_01": "You know, I could really take a shine to cannons. They do come in handy from time to time.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_02": "A cannon roar'll get us out of this one.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_03": "Wall. Cannon. Cannon. Wall. Do I have to draw you a bleedin' diagram?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_04": "What this problem needs is a very big bang.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_01": "I guess we ain't done, but there's no shame in a strategic withdrawal.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_02": "Reckon we're coming back. Lohner won't be happy with our news.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_03": "Lohner's bound to send us back. But I need a drink or two first.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_04": "Safe and sound. But we'll be back mates, by Taal we will!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_01": "Stick together, keep to the pace!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_02": "Close up! No wandering off now!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_03": "Double-quick! We'll be getting company!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_04": "No man, elf or dwarf left behind! Get moving!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_01": "Aha! Reckon this is what we're after, mates?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_02": "Neat little hidey-hole, this.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_03": "And here we have it. The Black Hook lair.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_04": "Hello! Anyone down there? We're just making a routine check for scum-sucking bandits. Nothing to worry about!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_01": "We need a defence position! Get in there!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_02": "Into the room! We'll hold 'em there!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_03": "We'll not last the twitch of a griffon's tail out here! Fortify that room!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_04": "We'll use that room as a bastion! Get in there!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_01": "Look lively! Get those windows sealed!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_02": "You want pact-sworn up your arse? Seal the windows!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_03": "Hammer them windows shut, mates!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_04": "Block the windows. We'll keep 'em out any way we can!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_01": "Taal! Now that's a stench that could choke a maggot!",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_02": "I don't like that smell. Or how my boots are sticking to the floor.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_03": "Smells like a three-days-drowned halfling, it does.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_04": "What a reek! Stinks like an Arch Lector's conscience.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_01": "The Black Hook gang, eh? Heard about them in Ubersreik.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_02": "Black Hook used to have a brotherhood in Ubersreik. Reckon the ratmen got 'em.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_03": "Right, where are these gangers? I'm in the mood to mete out a little justice.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_04": "The Black Hook. Takes me back. Used to shake down me folks, 'till I got big enough to throw a punch.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_a_01": "Joined the army to see the world, didn't I? Turns out, I only see it covered in mangy fur and filth.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_a_02": "Bögenhafen deserves better than plague. We'd best put a stop to it.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_b_01": "Heard the Black Hook were involved in this. No surprise there.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_b_02": "What about this talk of the Black Hook being involved? Seems sketchy to me.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_c_01": "Clobbering a few bandits? Count me in. Taal, but I love this job sometimes.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_c_02": "Nothing beats a bandit like... well, like me. Give me five minutes with one of the buggers, I'll get your answers.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_01": "The Steinhäger crest? So this has come from uptown.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_02": "That's the Steinhäger crest. This is nicked grub. Our problem didn't start here.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_03": "I know that crest on the crates. Wealthy family's bragging rights, it is.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_04": "Steinhäger... Oh, that's right. Wealthy buggers. Live up in the city proper.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_01": "Did someone say something? Reckon I've gone deaf.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_02": "Cannons. Nature's problem solvers. Well, not nature exactly, but problem solvers? Yes.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_03": "Oh, if only we could take that beautiful cannon with us...",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_04": "Reckon they'll have heard that, mates?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_01": "Wish we were over there. Then again, so do most of the poor.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_02": "See? That's Bögenhafen at its best, across the river.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_03": "Take a gander across the river if you want to see Bögenhafen proper.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_04": "Ah, Bögenhafen. Used to be such a quiet town.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_01": "Whew. Back to the search, I guess.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_02": "Let's have a look around, before we get more trouble.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_03": "Right, that's over. Let's get back to work.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_04": "What were we looking for again?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_01": "What a mess. Lot of folks join up to get out of places like this.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_02": "Not the Empire's finest side on display here, mates.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_03": "Wouldn't want to kip down here. Wake up with a slit throat, most likely.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_04": "Plenty of coin in Bögenhafen, but not much finds its way here - not honestly, leastways.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_01": "Don't know how the buggers live like this.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_02": "Filth on top of filth, and all of it falling into the mud...",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_03": "Makes me ashamed, seeing this. The Empire's supposed to be better'n this.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_04": "Taal! If I lived here, I'd scarper to the forest. Least the air's clean out there.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_01": "Looks like they've had a crack at one or two of the warehouses.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_02": "A bandit in Bögenhafen never goes hungry.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_03": "Half-inched, all of it. Impressive, in its way.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_04": "It's a wonder anything gets to where it's going.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_eight_01": "The Black Hook. Used to be a power in the Reikland, 'til they got sloppy.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_eight_02": "No one's really sure. But I hear tales of a botched raid on Helmgart's treasury. All went a bit quiet after that.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_five_01": "Hanging heavy everywhere, lately. Or had you not noticed things have gone a bit twitchy?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_four_01": "Yeah, funny how the penniless resent the wealthy, ain't it?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_four_02": "So I hear. Let me know when you find out what that is, yeah?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_one_01": "Wouldn't hurt you to say something nice once in a while, Kerillian.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_one_02": "About anything. Or any of us.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_six_01": "You what? Is that a threat?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_six_02": "Yeah? Well, still a ways to go on that one. Keep at it.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_three_01": "Yeah, but no one wants to be 'Worse than Bretonnia' do they?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_twelve_01": "Blimey! Bit exciting hereabouts, ain't it sir?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_twelve_02": "I don't mind that, sir. Just wish it'd leave ME alone for a bit, if you follow.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_twelve_03": "Ah. D'you need an answer right away, or can I think on it?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_two_01": "Not surprising. I mean, I like Karl Franz and all. Seems a fair man, with a grand taste in hats, but he's a penny-pincher.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_two_02": "I'm just saying that if we all had fancy magic swords like his we'd sort the northlanders out in no time. But then, he'd have fewer hats, wouldn't he?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_01": "Taal and Rhya! Stinks to high heavens, it does.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_02": "I'm no Bretonnian frog-gobbler, but even I know grub shouldn't look like that.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_03": "Yeah. Wouldn't eat that, if I were you. Something ain't right.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_tainted_food_04": "Food shouldn't look like that. Or smell like that. Don't wanna know how it tastes.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_01": "Ah, the Fifty-Eight! If only I could see inside.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_02": "The Fight-Eight warehouses - give me a five minute pass, and I'd be set up for life.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_03": "Beggars belief how those warehouses ain't empty. Not a watchman in sight.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_58_04": "Half the Reikland's trade comes through them warehouses, one way or the other.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_01": "This'll have a way through. Taal, I hope it does.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_02": "On we scramble. Keep moving, and look for openings.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_03": "We'd better hope this is the path.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_the_wall_04": "Progress. One step after the other, that's the way.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_01": "I hate it when it's quiet. Means trouble's coming.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_02": "Yeah, of course it's quiet. Won't stay that way...",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_03": "Stay alert, mates. Ain't no way we're not being watched.",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_slum_too_quiet_04": "Anyone else feel a little claustro... clustro... cluck... hemmed in?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_01": "Apothecary's workroom. Load up!",
	"pes_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_02": "Looks like an apothecary's den.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_03": "An apothecary's workroom? Take whatever you can.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_apothercary_room_04": "Bit of a medicine stash, looks like.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_01": "Wonder how long before someone locks me up in one of these?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_02": "Another six months of this life, I'll be begging for one of these cells.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_03": "Even the lunatics are gone. I wonder who took them?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_confinement_cells_04": "They've been here too. Who'd want a lunatic?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_correct_switch_01": "That did it! But there's another ahead.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_correct_switch_02": "Door's open... but there's another behind.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_correct_switch_03": "It's open. But another's shut.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_correct_switch_04": "Another bloody door? Not our lucky day, is it?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_cultist_door_01": "Bloody northlanders, daubing their symbols on our sewers...",
	"pes_level_catacombs_cultist_door_02": "Look at that. Northlander graffiti.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_cultist_door_03": "Wonder what that symbol means?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_cultist_door_04": "You reckon that sign has a meaning?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_healing_ward_01": "Bit of a scuffle occurred here.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_healing_ward_02": "Where are the wounded? Or their bodies?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_healing_ward_03": "Looks like there was a riot in here.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_healing_ward_04": "What a bloody mess.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_01": "I hear voices, and they ain't friendly ones.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_02": "Does anyone else hear that chant?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_03": "I don't like that sound. Every word laden with death.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_hear_chanting_04": "Are we sure we don't want to head back, mates?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_01": "Down there? Join the army, they said, and you'll see the world... lose your limbs.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_02": "You're not serious? I'm not jumping in that... Alright, alright...",
	"pes_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_03": "That hole's the only way forward. What a surprise.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_jump_into_intestine_hole_04": "Don't suppose anyone brought a rope?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_01": "I've heard of places like this but never seen one before.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_02": "This is an old catacomb. Maybe dating before Sigmar.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_03": "Old days buried down here, mates.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_mausoleum_entrance_04": "A catacomb? Can't be a coincidence, mates.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_01": "Reckon I preferred the shite and the sewer.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_02": "What is that muck?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_03": "Is it me, or is the smell getting worse?",
	"pes_level_catacombs_nurgle_water_04": "Taal! Even the air has texture in here. Think I'm gonna puke...",
	"pes_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_01": "Hah! One dead sorcerer. Good bloody riddance.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_02": "Dead sorcerer. We keep this up, the ritual's going to eat 'em all.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_03": "Looks like someone got the short end of the ritual stick - right in the belly!",
	"pes_level_catacombs_one_sorcerer_dead_04": "Sorcerer's dead. Reckon we're making progress.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_ritual_disrupted_ritual_01": "That did it!",

	"pes_level_catacombs_sabotage_ritual_03": "We're weakening the ritual, just by standing in the circle. Now all we have to do's survive.",

	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_01": "One wall down. Shame there are two.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_outer_gate_02": "Lovely. We get through one wall, and we find another.",

	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_portal_02": "The portal's over there. I can smell the ale already. Or is that the fungus between my toes!?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_portal_03": "Is that the bridge? About bloody time. Reckon I'm coming down with rotlung.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_portal_04": "Is that the portal? I'll be tearing leeches out of my skin for days...",

	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_eight_01": "I did. Poor sods strung up from that tree. It ain't right.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_eight_02": "Then what?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_eight_03": "Some days... you're a struggle, elf.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_five_01": "I take the risk willingly, Bardin. Someone needs to strike a blow for Ussingen.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_five_02": "No. I avenged them back in Ubersreik. But what about the dead who have no one to fight for 'em?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_seven_01": "You saw that tree. Our foes harness terrible sorceries.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_seven_02": "Warms my heart to hear you say so.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_ten_01": "This is a miserable swamp, and no mistake.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_ten_02": "Deep, are they?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_ten_03": "Think I might give that a miss, if it's all the same to you.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_three_01": "Reminds 'em of home, perhaps.",

	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_story_twelve_01": "Afraid of a little mud, Bardin?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_success_01": "Good bit of revenge, that. And we keep Lohner's base nice and secure.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_success_02": "Nice work, mates. Lohner's secrets remains his own.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_success_03": "Reckon Lohner owes us a nice, long drink after that. Maybe a sodding barrel.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_success_04": "Bit hairy in there, but we got it done. Lohner's safe.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_01": "I don't like the looks of that tree.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_02": "Poor buggers. Strung up like sides of meat.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_03": "Let's hope we don't end up kicking our heels like those poor sods.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_tree_04": "Horrible. You don't treat your enemies like that. Well, I don't leastways.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_wall_01": "Call 'emselves warriors? Real warriors don't daub their walls with innocent blood.",

	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_03": "Keep an eye on that tower. Might be more up there.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_04": "Look at that watchtower. What a mess!",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_which_way_01": "We need to pick a path and stay together.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_which_way_02": "Don't split up! We all take the same path.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_which_way_03": "I favour staying on dry ground if there's a choice, but I doubt that's an option.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_which_way_04": "Swamps. I hate sodding swamps. At least we can stay together.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_surprise_01": "Taal! This'll be close work! Now where's that champion?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_surprise_02": "Sigmar lend me strength, and show me that damn champion.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_surprise_03": "Come on, you buggers! Send out your best!",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_surprise_04": "Ussingen's farmers say 'hello', northlanders! Where's your leader?",
	"pes_level_crawl_intro_a_01": "Well, I can still see. So something tells me that wasn't the good stuff.",
	"pes_level_crawl_intro_a_02": "I'm not sure about that last lot. Had a funny taste. We can do better.",
	"pes_level_crawl_intro_b_01": "We'll need more ale if we're to keep the celebration going...",
	"pes_level_crawl_intro_b_02": "No more ale here, mates.",
	"pes_level_crawl_intro_c_01": "Then we'll just have to find some bleedin' more, won't we?",
	"pes_level_crawl_intro_c_02": "Never fear! Old Kruber will search out some more! Onwards!",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_01": "That's a tree and a half, ain't it?",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_02": "Think of the cannon you could mount on that bastard of a tree!",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_03": "That tree's done well to stay standing.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_04": "Can't deny, that tree's impressive.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_broken_waystone_01": "More smashed elf rocks.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_broken_waystone_02": "Shoddy masonry. I thought elves built to last.",

	"pes_level_elven_ruins_broken_waystone_04": "The monolith's seen better days.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_clearing_01": "One set of rocks looks much like another, if you ask me.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_clearing_02": "Perhaps it'd still be standing if they'd chosen structure over style.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_clearing_03": "I reckon the elves could learn a thing or two from us, when it comes to building.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_clearing_04": "Could be made homely enough, but it'd need a bit more colour.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_cliff_edge_01": "Not down there! The path's off to the right.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_cliff_edge_02": "So, that's what we've come to find? Bit fancy, ain't it?",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_cliff_edge_03": "Ignore the view. Let's keep moving.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_cliff_edge_04": "Which way to the temple proper, do you think?",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_01": "Guess it could've looked lovely, back in the day. Just mossed stone now.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_02": "Well, that's something you don't see every day.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_03": "So, this is elven work, is it? If it's so impressive, where's the roof?",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_entering_ruins_04": "Don't see the fascination, myself. Just a load of old stone.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_exit_01": "There's the Bridge. Down that passageway.",

	"pes_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_01": "I wish these trees weren't so tall. Makes a fellow feel insignificant.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_great_glade_02": "This is bad ground for a fight. Let's not linger.",

	"pes_level_elven_ruins_noisy_puzzle_04": "It's on the move, but that noise ain't subtle.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_01": "Don't stray too far! We don't want to get overwhelmed!",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_02": "How much further? This place is enormous.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_03": "They're gonna keep coming. We'll have to keep moving.",

	"pes_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_02": "The alignment's nearly done.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_second_aligned_03": "Just a little more. Can anyone reach that last crystal?",

	"pes_level_fort_story_seven_03": "Of course you do sir.",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_01": "Thank Sigmar! We've found it! But so have they...",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_02": "This is the way, mates. Has to be. I don't like the look of that gate...",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_03": "Up this way mates, but hurry. The gate's smashed in.",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_04": "That's what we've been looking for! Seems the enemy found it first.",
	"pes_level_fort_under_attack_01": "We have to get over there, and quickly. As long as those cannons keep firing, there's hope.",
	"pes_level_fort_under_attack_02": "They're still fighting back, but the siege isn't going well. We should hurry.",
	"pes_level_fort_under_attack_03": "If the cannons stop, the fort ain't gonna hold much longer.",
	"pes_level_fort_under_attack_04": "They better keep those cannons firing until we get there, or it'll all be in vain.",
	"pes_level_fort_use_cannons_01": "The only way to get rid of the rat catapults is the fort's cannon. Let's go, mates!",
	"pes_level_fort_use_cannons_02": "They got muck chucking catapults, but we have a Nuln-forged cannon. Better use it, mates!",
	"pes_level_fort_use_cannons_03": "Oi, we have a cannon! Just have to reach it first, then we'll see to the catapult problem!",
	"pes_level_fort_use_cannons_04": "We'll return fire! Look to the cannons!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_01": "Keep it up, mates! We're wearing him out! He's going down, sooner or later, that thieving, scheming, sorcerous dung-sack.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_02": "We're in this, mates. Keep up the pressure! We'll endure. They will crack! Press on!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_03": "Just keep bringing it, mates! We have that dung-neck just where we want him! He's not wobbling his way out of this one!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_spotted_01": "Oh, if you think I'm gonna play nice with you and your blasted ritual, you're lost at sea, mate.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_spotted_02": "Right, another absolute nutter, simply begging to be murdered by yours truly. Come on, let's get on with it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_spotted_03": "So this is Lohner's old book thief, eh? I hope none of you plan to chat with this lard-arse, cause I'm cutting straight to the killing.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_taunt_reply_01": "How they blether! I tell you, these rotblood sorcerers, they're aching for the old Kruber treatment.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_taunt_reply_02": "The only mist we're conjuring up today is a pink one. Yeah, that's when we strap you in front of a Nuln-forged cannon. Boom.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_taunt_reply_03": "Well, all I have to say to that, you rambling git, is the Sea of Claws is missing one of its blubbery whales. I just caught it. Soon have it gutted, too.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canals_01": "Not the worst canals I've seen, but not the cleanest either.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canals_02": "Yeah, that water ain't for drinking...",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canals_03": "Look for a way over the canal.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canals_04": "We'll have to cross somewhere. Let's hope we don't have to swim.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canal_crossing_01": "Try that house? There has to be a way across.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canal_crossing_02": "Have we tried that house, mates? Might have answers.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canal_crossing_03": "We need a crossing point, and we need it quick.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_canal_crossing_04": "Search every ruin. There must be some way across.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_cargo_elevator_01": "That looks promising. You reckon that's our lifting platform?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_cargo_elevator_02": "Is that the guildsmen's lift we were promised?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_cargo_elevator_03": "There's our lifting platform. C'mon, move your feet!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_cargo_elevator_04": "That's what we were looking for. All aboard!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_complete_01": "By Taal, we got him! He had it coming, a long time coming, but yeah, we got him good.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_complete_02": "Gotcha! Lohner sends his regards, you blub-necked, book-thieving, poison-loving bugger.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_complete_03": "By Taal, we got him! He had it coming, a long time coming, but yeah, we got him good.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_complete_04": "Hah! Lost a tree, northlanders? Shame.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_corruption_everywhere_01": "Yeah, this ain't any kind of natural, is it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_corruption_everywhere_02": "They're making a real mess down here, ain't they?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_corruption_everywhere_03": "This ain't right, daemon-plants cropping up in my homeland. Bloody northlanders.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_corruption_everywhere_04": "Well, this is horrible. Be glad when we've put a stop to it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_crumbling_01": "Can we find something a bit more stable, and quickly?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_crumbling_02": "Don't like the footing here. Not at all.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_crumbling_03": "The ground's bloody shifting. Can we, um, skip this part, mates?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_crumbling_04": "The ground's bloody shifting. Can we, um, skip this part, mates?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_01": "Slice those ropes, mates. We need the bridge down.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_02": "Sever the ropes, that'll drop the bridge.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_03": "The bridge is still up, but a good hack at the capstan will fix that.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_04": "A bridge! Now how to lower it...?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_get_clear_01": "Back up! It's going to blow!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_get_clear_02": "Get out of there!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_get_clear_03": "Fall back, mates! Quickly!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_get_clear_04": "Get clear! I reckon it's about to pop!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_01": "Look at that! Bloody horrible, ain't it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_02": "That's our daemon-tree.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_03": "Now ain't that a revolting sight? And I've seen a lot.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_04": "When Lohner called it a daemon-tree, he weren't joking.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_01": "There has to be a weak spot.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_02": "So, how we doing this? I'm open to ideas.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_03": "It has to die, which means we have to find a way to kill it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_04": "Should've brought an axe. A nice, big, flaming axe.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_01": "Right, how about this? Black powder, shoved right down its gullet.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_02": "Explosives. That's what we need.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_03": "We had a saying, back in my regiment: you can't have enough black powder.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_04": "The thing has a big mouth. How about we stuff it with explosives?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_01": "I think this might be working!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_02": "Don't seem so daft a plan now, does it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_03": "That's looking good! Feed it another!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_04": "Hungry bugger, isn't it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_01": "Horrible bloody monster, that. Let's uproot it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_02": "Disgusting! Let's get rid of it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_03": "There's a way to kill it. Got to be.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_04": "So, how do we kill it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_01": "Cut your way through!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_02": "Out of my way, vines!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_03": "Hack 'em down! Keep moving!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_04": "They'll part! Just slice 'em.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_hole_second_view_03": "Just gets worse the more I see. What have they done...",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_hole_second_view_04": "More dead down there than I can count, I promise you that.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_landslide_01": "Would you look at that! Lots of earth on the move.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_landslide_02": "Hillside's on the move! Better watch where we walk.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_landslide_03": "Bloody hillside's coming down!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_landslide_04": "Landslide! Bit of luck it'll crush plenty of ratmen.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_looking_for_elevator_01": "The guildsmen's lift can't be far.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_looking_for_elevator_02": "Pick up the pace, mates. We need to get down there.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_looking_for_elevator_03": "No sign of this lifting platform yet.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_looking_for_elevator_04": "Guildsmen's lift, wasn't it? You don't think we could have passed it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_precarious_01": "Little wobble there, but I'm fine.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_precarious_02": "Eyes front, mates. Don't think about the drop.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_precarious_03": "Don't look down, that's my advice.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_precarious_04": "Glad I've not had a drop this morning. Bad enough sober.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_smell_01": "Unbearable smells come with the job, nowadays. Every sodding time.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_smell_02": "I've emptied latrines that don't smell that bad.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_smell_03": "That's a stench that'll stay with me.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_smell_04": "Yeah. Horrible. Just horrible.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_eleven_01": "Let's hope nothing nasty comes out of Axe Bite Pass. Not sure Helmgart's any good for stopping it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_eleven_02": "Aye, you're right.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_four_01": "Don't get why the Rotbloods love filth so.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_four_01_x": "Daemon, I get. But why a tree, sir?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_four_02": "Funny sort of life, that.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_four_02_x": "Never did trust gardeners. All that grubbing about in the soil. I mean, what's the good of plants you can't eat?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_seven_01": "I keep hearing you speak of the Weave, Kerillian, but not what it is.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_seven_02": "Funny. I've never noticed anything.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_two_01": "Not me. A simple, bluff soldier, me. I keep to the things I know.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_story_two_02": "Long enough. So many ways to kill a body, be they human, greenskin, ratman... or elf.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_the_hole_01": "Taal! Bloody Pact-swine have done this place in, and no mistake.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_the_hole_02": "The centre of Helmgart... It's just... gone. Taal save us.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_the_hole_03": "Ain't no words for that. Sigmar knows how many died down there.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_the_hole_04": "Just look what the pact-scum have done! Taal and Sigmar, this needs proper revenging.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_the_hole_second_view_01": "What a bleeding righteous mess! As I said, we owe payback for this, mates.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_the_hole_second_view_02": "Poor bloody Helmgart. And I thought we had it bad in Ubersreik.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_town_01": "I thought the rat-bastards had hit Helmgart harder than this.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_town_02": "Not as bad as I thought. Place looks defensible, even.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_town_03": "Is it me, or is the town in pretty good nick, given what Lohner told us?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_town_04": "Well mates. Looks like Helmgart's not as bad as we thought.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_01": "Hear that? Loudest ambush since Salkaten. Stupid beastmen mewling in the bushes.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_02": "If that's an ambush, I'm not impressed. Just listen to that.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_03": "They're waiting for us. We'll be more than ready though.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_welcoming_committee_04": "I hear 'em. Time to silence those sorry buggers.",

	"pes_level_helmgart_military_armoury_02": "Fill your pouches. No point wasting it.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_armoury_03": "Cleaned out, except for a few bits and bobs.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_armoury_04": "Not much left. See what you can find!",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_01": "And here we are. Don't suppose we've time for a breather?",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_02": "Pact-sworn have been here before us, looks like.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_03": "Looks like someone tried to hold this place.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_arriving_temple_04": "Tried to hold this place, didn't they. Doesn't look like it worked.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_01": "Axe Bite Pass. Don't have fond memories of that place, if I'm honest.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_02": "Axe Bite Pass. Lost a lot of good men back there. The rain came in, guns wouldn't fire... Bad times.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_03": "Axe Bite Pass. With Helmgart in this state, who's gonna keep the greenskins back?",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_axebite_pass_vista_04": "Let's hope the greenskins of Axe Bite Pass stay nice and quiet. We don't need more trouble.",

	"pes_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_03": "We heading through that door?",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_03a": "By Sigmar, if the temple blows out a door for us, I believe it shows us the way.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04": "We need a way out. How about that door?",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04a": "We need a way out. How about that door?",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_empty_town_01": "Pact-sworn bastards, they'll regret crossing paths with me!",

	"pes_level_helmgart_military_helmgart_vista_03": "Don't know about you, but I'm growing pretty damn tired of seeing the Skaven tear down my homeland.",

	"pes_level_helmgart_military_time_to_leave_02": "Time to get out of here. I reckon we're a bit too popular right now.",
	"pes_level_helmgart_military_time_to_leave_03": "And that's the job done. Time for a well-earned drink.",

	"pes_level_mine_found_cart_troll_cave_03": "Taal! I think that's our cart!",
	"pes_level_mine_found_cart_troll_cave_04": "That's our cart. Ranald's been playing with us, I reckon.",

	"pes_level_mine_impressive_cave_01": "I prefer the sun on my face, but there's something grand about this cave.",
	"pes_level_mine_impressive_cave_02": "Hey, who moved the roof?",
	"pes_level_mine_impressive_cave_03": "Could hide an army down here. Let's hope they haven't.",
	"pes_level_mine_impressive_cave_04": "Could build a fortress down here. Maybe we should, once we've evicted this lot?",
	"pes_level_mine_ladder_01": "Don't like the look of that ladder. Bit rickety for my tastes.",
	"pes_level_mine_ladder_02": "Are we sure there's no other way down?",

	"pes_level_mine_lost_cart_01": "So... Where do you think the cart went?",
	"pes_level_mine_lost_cart_02": "Keep your eyes open - the cart must be around somewhere.",

	"pes_level_mine_lost_cart_04": "Spread out. Let's find that cart.",
	"pes_level_mine_mine_cart_01": "Sturdy-looking cart... Bring it along.",
	"pes_level_mine_mine_cart_02": "Someone give that cart a shove. We can use it.",
	"pes_level_mine_mine_cart_03": "We shouldn't leave that cart behind.",

	"pes_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_back_04": "Do I have to say it again? Push the cart!",
	"pes_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_forward_01": "Um... Is it supposed to do that?",
	"pes_level_mine_mine_cart_roll_down_forward_02": "Don't let the cart get away, mates!",

	"pes_level_mine_portal_02": "There's the portal. I've had enough of this place.",
	"pes_level_mine_portal_03": "No more trolls! A good day's work, mates. Time for a walk through the portal, a kip, and an ale.",
	"pes_level_mine_portal_04": "There it is. Time to go home!",
	"pes_level_mine_story_eleven_01": "Here's a thing, Bardin. Why do you dwarfs live underground?",
	"pes_level_mine_story_eleven_02": "Because it's normal, that's why.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_eleven_a_01": "A proper beard? I'll have you know these sideburns have had many admirers.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_eleven_a_02": "You can stop helping me now, elf.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_five_01": "Using sorcery to mutate the trolls. I'd no idea such a thing was possible.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_five_02": "Speaking for myself, I'm content to wait. Better to have a surprise or two than weeks of bad dreams in anticipation.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_seven_01": "Thinking with your coin-purse at a time like this, Bardin?",
	"pes_level_mine_story_seven_02": "That's different. I'm mercenary scum nowadays. No one expects fine sentiment from me.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_six_01": "Not like you to be timorous, sir.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_six_02": "Yessir! Means 'nervous'.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_ten_01": "So... Maybe we pelt the trolls with rotten vegetables.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_ten_02": "Really? Never knew that. Pelt 'em with rotten fruit, then.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_ten_03": "Ah.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_thirteen_01": "Lead her on? Lead her on? Woman's a menace. Won't leave me alone.",
	"pes_level_mine_story_thirteen_02": "Lead her on? Daft old biddy doesn't need any leading.",

	"pes_level_mine_troll_doors_04": "Trolls nearby, let's get this done and quickly!",
	"pes_level_mine_troll_food_storage_01": "And now I've lost my appetite... forever.",
	"pes_level_mine_troll_food_storage_02": "What a... No, I don't even have the words for it.",
	"pes_level_mine_troll_food_storage_03": "Have they been feeding the trolls on... plague rats?",
	"pes_level_mine_troll_food_storage_04": "The trolls have been eating... plague rats? Revolting.",
	"pes_level_mine_warren_01": "Oh, this is a proper mine! Could be anything down here.",
	"pes_level_mine_warren_02": "Remember, stay close to the tracks, and we won't go far wrong.",
	"pes_level_mine_warren_03": "Don't wander off. Could lose you forever in this lot.",
	"pes_level_mine_warren_04": "Busy buggers, these miners. Must've taken them decades to do all this.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_01": "Funny place to have a kip.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_02": "Yeah, don't think he lay down there all willing, like.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_03": "Anyone else get a funny feeling off that altar?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_04": "There's a sight to shiver the blood. Wonder how he got there?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_barrier_01": "That'll break. Just give it a whack.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_barrier_02": "What're you waiting for? Break it down.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_barrier_03": "Give it a whack, mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_barrier_04": "We'll have to break our way through.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_bury_objective_01": "No bright plans except Lohner's, alright? Hack those cluster-things.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_bury_objective_02": "Time to pop some Nurgle pimples, mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_bury_objective_03": "Guess this is where we start kicking this thing in its weak points, mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_bury_objective_04": "If I catch anything from these bloody buboes we're supposed to bash, Lohner better have a cure",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_01": "That's all of them in this area, mates! Find more lesions to lash.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_02": "Wonder if I'll have gotten used to this by the time we've busted every last one of em. Probably not.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_03": "Oh, that hit it where it hurts, mates! We're done here, we need more pustules to pop!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_04": "Our dear old Keep Keepers did their reading up right once again it seems. We're doing damage!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_01": "Hear that? Yeah, didn't need a score of wizards to hurt you, did we?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_02": "Bless that leathery crone, her method works again! The earth and rock will do the job if this continues!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_03": "Judging by that calamity, we've done enough here, mates! Seek out more of the same.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_04": "That's the reaction we want, mates! Come on, let's charge headlong into more disgustingness!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_coming_down_01": "Oh yes! The drop that broke the camel's back! No wait.. um.. run to the surface!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_coming_down_02": "Daemon cave is coming down, coming down! The surface and the portal, mates, is all that matters now!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_coming_down_03": "Oh, that did the trick, mates! Last one to the surface is a large-nostriled dung collector!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_coming_down_04": "That's it! Hah! Make for the surface, mates! The burying has begun!",
	"pes_level_nurgle_digsite_01": "We're getting closer, mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_digsite_02": "Can you sense it? We're close.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_digsite_03": "I think we're close. mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_digsite_04": "We're closing in, darlings.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_drop_down_01": "Looks like we're heading down.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_drop_down_02": "Down we go, mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_drop_down_03": "Path leads down. Lucky bloody us.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_drop_down_04": "Down, down, down. Same old story.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_01": "Yeah. This ain't the place. Too old.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_02": "This place has been here bloody years. It's not the one we want.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_03": "I'm no expert, but this place looks ancient. Move on.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_04": "Doesn't look like much has been dug up here for centuries.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_01": "Another mission completed. I feel pretty good about this one.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_02": "Where's the Bridge? I don't want to be buried alive.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_03": "We can't stay here, mates. Look for the portal.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_04": "Where's the bleedin' portal. Just our luck to be buried too.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_01": "Would you look at that...? Vile stuff.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_02": "Never been one for ooze...",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_03": "Ain't natural, none of it.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_04": "Yeah, I'm not touching that muck, not for all the coin in Reikland.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_increase_01": "Just when I thought it couldn't get worse.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_increase_02": "This is horrible. Like something from a nightmare. And not one of my ones that you lot laugh at.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_increase_03": "Revolting stuff. Why worship a god who never does nothing nice?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_nurglification_increase_04": "I think it's the smell that's the worst bit, though all that slime ain't exactly pleasant.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_outcast_lair_01": "A bandit camp? Looks like they got what they deserved.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_outcast_lair_02": "Bandits get everywhere. Soon as you stamp one lot out, more spring up.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_outcast_lair_03": "Will you look at that, a bandit camp. Seems the pact-sworn got to 'em before I could.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_outcast_lair_04": "A bandit camp? They're lucky the pact-sworn got 'em first.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_river_01": "Lohner mentioned a river. Let's hope this is the right one.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_river_02": "You reckon this is the river Lohner mentioned, mates?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_river_03": "So... This river means we're on the right path? Let's hope so.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_river_04": "Hard to find bearing around here, but I reckon we're on the right path.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_ruins_01": "Wonder how long this has been abandoned?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_ruins_02": "Been a while since this was home to anyone.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_ruins_03": "No shortage of abandoned villages in the Reikland.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_ruins_04": "Hard to imagine fellowship and laughter in a place like this, eh mates?",
	"pes_level_nurgle_skaven_collapse_01": "Well, well, well. Looks like the ratmen have hit a snag or two.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_skaven_collapse_02": "Skaven dig fast, but they don't dig safe.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_skaven_collapse_03": "Whole pile of dead ratmen. Saves me the bother.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_skaven_collapse_04": "Looks like they forgot to tunnel safely. Cryin' shame.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_spotting_objective_01": "There it is! Bleedin' revolting.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_spotting_objective_02": "That's got to be our monolith. Can't be two like that in the world. I hope.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_spotting_objective_03": "Reckon we're here. Look at that bloody mess of evil.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_spotting_objective_04": "There's what we came for. Gonna take a while to unsee that.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_swift_river_01": "Ah, the rush of water. Always welcome, as long as the bridge holds.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_swift_river_02": "That water's a bit lively, mates.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_swift_river_03": "Not sure I fancy a swim, not with all this armour.",
	"pes_level_nurgle_swift_river_04": "Always liked the riverside. Don't know why.",

	"pes_level_prologue_almost_there_03": "Let's find Saltzpyre, and this portal of Madame Pimenova's.",
	"pes_level_prologue_almost_there_04": "No slacking. We're not out of this yet!",
	"pes_level_prologue_alone_01": "Wish I weren't alone. Wouldn't even say no to hearing Saltzpyre's grating tones.",
	"pes_level_prologue_alone_02": "Now Sienna - she'd know how to escape. Likely burn us right out of this cage, she would.",
	"pes_level_prologue_alone_03": "Think Kruber, think! There's a way out of this mess! Bardin wouldn't give up. Nor can you!",
	"pes_level_prologue_alone_04": "At least Kerillian's not here. She'd be telling me this is all my fault.",

	"pes_level_prologue_bardin_passing_one_01": "Guess I've found my first one",

	"pes_level_prologue_bardin_passing_one_02b": "Oh you bloody nutter...",
	"pes_level_prologue_bardin_passing_two_01": "Bardin! Hush! Keep a lid on it, alright?",
	"pes_level_prologue_bardin_passing_two_03": "Down and to the right. Got ya.",
	"pes_level_prologue_barred_01": "Need something to break that down. Think, Kruber. Think!",

	"pes_level_prologue_cage_see_weapon_01": "You don't need that one anymore, mate...",
	"pes_level_prologue_chaos_01": "Yeah, that's right. We've got a new problem: northlanders.",
	"pes_level_prologue_chaos_02": "Yeah, did I not mention? The ratmen are in league with the northlanders.",
	"pes_level_prologue_chaos_03": "So about the ratmen... they're working with the northlanders...",
	"pes_level_prologue_chaos_04": "As you may have noticed, our ratty friends have some new playmates of their own...",
	"pes_level_prologue_dodge_01": "That bloody hurt. Maybe dodge the next, eh?",
	"pes_level_prologue_dodge_02": "Dodging, Markus. Heard it's a good thing.",

	"pes_level_prologue_elevator_ride_02": "Um, can we talk about that? I mean 'this'. A sodding 'Skittergate', northlanders and skaven together, Olesya in my head...",
	"pes_level_prologue_elevator_ride_03": "Taals teeth. Back to normal for us then.",
	"pes_level_prologue_elevator_ride_03_curse": "Bloody hell. Back to normal for us then.",
	"pes_level_prologue_elevator_rising_01": "They're in a tearing hurry to get us back, ain't they?",
	"pes_level_prologue_elevator_rising_02": "Looks like the ratmen ain't giving up yet.",

	"pes_level_prologue_weapons_04": "That's what I needed. Now to crack some skaven skulls!",
	"pes_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_01": "The ratmen are up to something. Didn't hear much. Something about a pact.",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_01": "One last touch - let's rip that banner down.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_02": "Let's bring the banner down. It's bound to make the ratmen furious.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_03": "Here, let's pull that banner down. That'll rile 'em up for sure.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_04": "Give me a hand, mates. We'll pull the banner down.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_01": "Look at this place. Rats everywhere, and the smell...",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_02": "I don't want to hear any jokes about Ubersreik's poor quarter, alright?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_downtown_03": "Just how many rats are there down here, anyway?",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_exit_03": "So, is Olesya gonna be ready? That's the question.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_exit_04": "So this was a forge, was it? Well, it ain't now.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_01": "Dead end here, mates. We'll have to swing around to reach the forge.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_02": "No way following those tracks. We better find some other way to the forge.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_01": "Alright, here's the tracks. Should lead us to the foundry.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_02": "Tracks. Just follow 'em, like Lohner said.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_01": "So this was a forge, was it? Well, it ain't one now.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_02": "Looks like the Skaven tried to use the foundry. Didn't go well for 'em, to no-one's surprise.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_03": "You got to hand it to the Skaven - takes a good deal of effort to bugger something like this up.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_foundry_entered_04": "You can imagine what this foundry would have been like back in the day - before the Skaven...",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_01": "Rat ogres. Sounds like lots of them. Then again, one's too many.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_02": "You hear that? Rat ogres...",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_03": "I hear rat ogres. Wish I didn't...",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_04": "That sounds like rat ogres...",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_lifting_device_moved_01": "Hah! Nice surprise there!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_lifting_device_moved_02": "Hah! You saw that? I hope you saw that. mates.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_01": "I can't believe it all still works. Dwarfs are bloody marvellous.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_02": "It's clever stuff, this dwarf-craft, ain't it?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_03": "You reckon the rest of it's working?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_light_brazier_04": "This place has been in Skaven hands for how long? And the mechanism still works?",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_long_way_down_03": "Steady on yer feet, mates.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_long_way_down_04": "Wouldn't want to slip and fall around here, eh?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_01": "So that's that. Weren't so hard, was it?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_02": "Well, that's what Lohner wanted...",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_03": "I reckon we're done, mates.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_mission_complete_04": "Killing a warlord? Nothing to it.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_01": "Oi! Somebody that junk out of the way!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_02": "Rat-city's on fire. Bloody brilliant.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_01": "Close up, and keep quiet.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_02": "Patrols ahead. Let's keep a low profile.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_patrol_lanes_03": "No need to engage the patrols. Stay quiet.",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_01": "So, the sneaky approach? I think we can forget about that, folks.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_02": "I guess the quiet approach is off. Hey, I never said I'd be any good at sneaking, did I?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eight_01": "Dwarfs are clever folk. Think what their machines could do for the Empire.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eight_02": "Seems a bit cautious, if you ask me.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eleven_01": "Don't suppose the armoury's still intact? I wouldn't mind a dwarf-forged handgun.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eleven_02": "On me?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_five_01": "Are there many Skaven clans, sir?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_five_02": "That's a pleasant thought.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_three_01": "What're you grumbling about, Bardin?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_three_02": "Well, just make something up. Skaven are paranoid. They'll believe anything.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_twelve_01": "So here's a thing... Shouldn't we try to get the Skaven and the northlanders at each others' throats too?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_twelve_02": "Aye, wouldn't be surprised if he did. Not anymore.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_victor_one_01": "Sir, the Skaven Warlord, seems you had a bit of history with him. If you don't mind me asking?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_01": "You're done, rat! Clan Mors sends their regards!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_02": "Time to die, ratman! Greetings from Clan Mors!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_03": "You ain't walking away from this, vermin!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_taunt_warlord_04": "Oi, rat-bastard we got paid by Clan Mors to shut yer muzzle for ever!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_viaduct_01": "We have a viaduct, mates. Head for it.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_viaduct_02": "There's the viaduct. Move.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_01": "The more I see of dwarf holds, the more I like 'em. They deserve a better fate.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_02": "This is a bloody marvellous view, not counting the Skaven, of course.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_03": "Just look at this view. Someday I'll see a hold in glory, not in ruin.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_vista_04": "Dwarfs do everything on a grand scale, don't they? You can't help but admire it.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_01": "We ready for the warlord?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_02": "So we kill the warlord, then get out, yeah?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_03": "Ready, mates? The warlord's nest is just ahead.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_04": "Sigmar stand with us - the warlord's nest is right there!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_01": "Is that the warlord's nest?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_02": "That'll be the nest we want, I reckon.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_03": "See that nest? Bet that's where we need to be.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_04": "Over there! That looks like the nest we want.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_01": "That did it! Our way is clear.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_02": "Look at that. We've got a way through.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_03": "Oi, that did the trick.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_complete_04": "It's a regular cave of wonders down here, and we've got a way forwards.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_01": "I think we need to realign the waterwheel.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_02": "Maybe we need to set that waterwheel straight.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_03": "Can we get that waterwheel back into position? It might help.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_waterwheel_move_04": "No obvious way through, but... Is it me, or is the waterwheel in the wrong place?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_01": "Give that lever a tug, and the thing should fire up. Lohner's words, not mine.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_01a": "Get the thing alive. Put that Keystaff to use!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_02": "Control lever's over there, looks like.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_02a": "Well, what are you waiting for? Use the Keystaff.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_03": "That's the lever. Step to it, mates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_03a": "Let's get the gate open, mates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_04": "Someone pull the lever. No sense hanging about waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_activate_gate_04a": "Keystaff and gate controls, finally about to meet, eh?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_arrive_01": "Urrg... where's my bloody ale?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_arrive_02": "So, everybody ok? No one ejected as spray of flesh and bone? Lovely.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_arrive_03": "Can you believe it? All the way to Norsca in the blink of an eye and a turn of the stomach.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_arrive_04": "Taal's vigour, we're here, and not as a mist of blood and gore. I'd call that a success.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_back_home_01": "Whoa... Praise Taal, Sigmar and Ranald... feels like that son of a gate really tried to eat me.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_back_home_02": "Whew! We bloody made it, mates, horrible as it was. A quick tentacle check leaves us fine too.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_back_home_03": "Gah. Feels like I was turned inside out and then back again. But I'm still standing and I'm ready for an ale, so who bloody cares...",
	"pes_level_skittergate_back_home_04": "Ouff. We're back. And with no tentacles, thank Taal. Looks like we ain't free and clear yet, mind.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_BOOM_01": "And that was the end of that!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_BOOM_02": "No more trouble from the skittergate!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_BOOM_03": "Sigmar! That definitely did it, mates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_BOOM_04": "Glad we weren't in it when it blew.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_01": "Well, ain't that lovely. We've hit 'em so hard, they can't even afford a decent guard detail.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_02": "Aye, killing the rat warlord thinned their ranks good and proper, mates. 'Twas a good plan.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_03": "Bit empty, not that I'm complaining. Should've offed a couple of more Warlords while we we're at it, eh?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_cave_entrance_04": "Aye, this close to gate and still no massive army against us? Nice. I approve of skaven civil war.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_contol_panel_01": "So that's the gate controls, eh?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_contol_panel_02": "Gate controls right here, when we're ready.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_contol_panel_03": "Gate controls, like Lohner described. We're a Keystaff short though.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_contol_panel_04": "We'll be back for those controls in a bit, mates. We've got work to do.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crater_01": "Taal! It looks worse every time I see it. Should start closing my eyes.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crater_02": "I've a burning need to make the ratties pay for this. Who's with me?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crater_03": "It's like the world swallowed the town up. A hungry, evil world.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crater_04": "When the skaven bastards ruin a town, they don't mess about, do they?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_01": "Just a thought, but what if those crates are warpstone shipments?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_02": "Could be some warpstone in those crates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_03": "Maybe the northlanders are supplying the warpstone? If so, there might be some at the docks.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_04": "We may as well die searching for more warpstone. Let's start with the dockside.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_01": "Good riddance.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_02": "Oh, but I enjoyed that.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_03": "That's my folks avenged. Took too damn long.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_04": "Next time you kill a Kruber, make sure you kill 'em all.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_01": "Yeah... Now we're here, I'm not rightly sure we can touch that thing.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_02": "We should've thought this through a bit more.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_03": "We might've bitten off too much this time. How d'we destroy that thing?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_04": "Call me simple, but I'd thought there'd be something we can smash.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_docks_gate_01": "Double time! Let's get inside!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_docks_gate_02": "Pick up yer feet! Move!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_docks_gate_03": "Get inside, mates. We haven't got all day.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_docks_gate_04": "Push on through! Don't let 'em stop you!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_elevator_01": "Lifting platform? It's going where we want.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_elevator_02": "I fancy using that lifting platform.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_elevator_03": "How about using the lifting platform?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_elevator_04": "That lifting platform'll save us a long walk.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_01": "Don't suppose that camp's empty?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_02": "Of course there's an army in the way.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_03": "There's a camp ahead, but we can't let that stop us, can we?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_04": "No matter what happens, we stick together, and keep fighting. Agreed?",

	"pes_level_skittergate_fire_gatekeeper_transform_02": "King Taal, I don't know what I just saw, but it doesn't really matter now, does it? We've a spawn in our face!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_fire_gatekeeper_transform_03": "A spawn? Taal's teeth, but I could have done without that.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_follow_01": "We'll have to follow him!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_follow_02": "Come on, mates! Through the skittergate!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_follow_03": "We'll continue this from the other side!",

	"pes_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_04": "Those ships are the terror of our Northern coast. Like black and hungry ghosts.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_02": "Oh, you daft bloody sodder. Do you realize I completely stopped listening to all your bull-dung bravado countless fights ago? Just shut yer gob, and get on with the dying.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_03": "Oi, that's another fine load of rubbish, bloat-bag. Come greet old Kruber... we'll say hello and chit-chat, up close and permanent.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_appear_04": "Mates, I paid no mind to his bellowing, but even Kruber, the simpleton, knows a Gatekeeper when he sees one.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_gatekeeper_death_02": "Alright. Now I've seen that too. And it's not something you're likely to un-see either. So, uhm, anyone got the Keystaff?",

	"pes_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_02": "Pick yer feet up and step lively now! The Keystaff needs to meet the gate controls, the sooner the better.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_get_back_to_gate_04": "Fine bit of robbery there, mates. Following Lohner's plan, we now got a Keystaff to use and a gate to wreck.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_leave_02": "I need a drink. Can we go find one?",

	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_reply_01": "Oi, third time's the charm, seer-bastard! You want to save your precious Rotblood spawner, you have to go through us. And even if not, we're going through you.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_gate_reply_02": "Aye, we did it. I confess. We touched your beloved gate. And offed scores upon scores of your rats and allies. Did I mention the high ranking sodders? Champions, Warlords and the like? Yeah, we killed them too.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_interrupt_and_focus_01": "The rat-sodder can't cast spells if he's being pummelled, mates.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_01": "So this is just a game to you? I'll have your head, rat!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_02": "Do your worst. I ain't giving up.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_03": "And yet I'm still standing.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_01": "Seer-bastard jumped away again! Stay on him!",

	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_03": "How many times have we chased this rat? Let this one be the last!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_rasknitt_teleport_away_04": "Always a lot of chasing with this one! Argh, the chase is not better than the catch!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_replace_power_01": "Get the warpstone in place.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_replace_power_02": "Well, what are you waiting for? Power it up.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_03": "We're done! To the gate! Run like Olesya's downed Ardora's libidinous love-punch!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_run_for_the_gate_04": "We've done enough! Time to leg it, mates, To the gate! Move! Move!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_01": "So, smash these contraptions, right? No need to tell me twice.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_02": "Yeah, this must be it. Smash the ratman gadgets, mates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_03": "Yeah, we smash these, it'll get a bit hot in here.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_sabotage_cooling_04": "Smash the lot! It's the only way! Give 'em a good walloping!",

	"pes_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_03": "We're just killing the same old lot here, mates. What about that frisky Gatekeeper we were promised?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_searching_gatekeeper_04": "Listen, if I hear something like 'the Gatekeeper, and Keystaff, have been transferred to Troll Country', I start drinking for real.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_01": "There it is. First thing I saw after waking up in a clattering skaven cage. Can't believe I'm actually gonna use it.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_02": "That's the skittergate, alright. Got a good look at it from the cage.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_03": "Skittergate spotted. And we stick to the plan. No fancy dancing, alright? Unless you bring ale, lots of ale. .",
	"pes_level_skittergate_skittergate_found_04": "There it is. Couldn't rightly forget it, could I?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_01": "That's our way in, mates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_02": "There we go. Our way in.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_02": "Alright, we're scheduled for some armed robbery next. The Gatekeeper's got something we need.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_03": "Gate's quiet, mates. Let's lay our hands on this Keystaff and get the hell out.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_04": "We've a Gatekeeper stomping around, flaunting his Keystaff, and his day isn't ruined yet! Come on, mates!",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_eleven_01": "That lot ain't reaching Helmgart, 'cept over my dead body.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_story_five_01": "That bloody grey seer. I'd like to end him once and for all.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_five_02": "Yeah, reckon he's stolen most of my luck. It's been a hell of a year.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_four_01": "So how are we going to destroy the skittergate, sir?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_four_02": "I'm sure, but if he doesn't?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_four_03": "I'd rather have a steam tank.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_one_01": "Careful, Kerillian, you almost sounded like you care.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_one_02": "You don't fool me. That heart of yours ain't as icy as you pretend.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_three_01": "Thank you, sir! And you've been... erm...",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_three_02": "Committed to your ideals, sir. Been most inspiring, it has.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_story_two_01": "Long odds this time, Bardin. Shall we give 'em one last fight?",

	"pes_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_03": "Taal and Sigmar, I confess, I do ask a lot...",
	"pes_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_04": "Alright, deep breath, Markus, and just plunge in. Worked before, didn't it?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_04b": "Alright, deep breath, Markus, and just plunge in. Worked before, didn't it?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_01": "Almost poetic, that - the skaven crushed by their own tunnels.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_02": "All those rats crushed. What a shame, I don't think.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_03": "That had a finality to it, eh?",

	"pes_level_skittergate_vacated_area_03": "Seems like our shadow crone was right. Rasknitt's busy elsewhere.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vacated_area_04": "Oh, ain't that a shame - Rasknitt ain't here to defend his little toy, and we're in the mood to play.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vast_camp_01": "Going by that lot, we're just in the nick of time.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vast_camp_02": "That's a whole mess of northlanders, and no mistake.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vast_camp_03": "Can we pick up the pace? I don't want to be here when that lot realise what's going on.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vast_camp_04": "Yeah, that lot's not reaching the Reikland, I promise you that.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vista_01": "Of course there's an huge bloody army in the way. Thank Taal for the entrance through the docks... should it exist.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vista_02": "Follow the plan, and stick to the path to the docks. That northlander horde is simply too much.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vista_03": "Rivers of Taal and Fields of Rhya, that camp is far too huge. Stick to the plan, mates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_vista_04": "Oi! No One's stupid enough to charge down that camp, yeah? We go around, find that back door, and do it right.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_01": "Northern Norsca. Roughly how I imagined it, at least so far.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_04": "Why couldn't there be seats on that thing?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_winch_01": "Don't fancy dragging that rock up the hill. Can we use the winch?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_winch_02": "That winch-way looks sturdy enough. Might save us a long drag.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_winch_03": "Lucky us. The Skaven already solved the problem of getting it up the hill.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_winch_04": "That winch will save us a long, hard shove.",

	"pes_level_ussingen_at_last_end_02": "There's the portal. Time to leave Ussingen behind.",
	"pes_level_ussingen_at_last_end_03": "The portal is just ahead. Bless that leathery crone!",

	"pes_level_ussingen_cart_idea_02": "That cart's just what we need. Pack it full of stuff that goes boom.",
	"pes_level_ussingen_cart_idea_03": "See that cart? Fill it with black powder!",
	"pes_level_ussingen_cart_idea_04": "You know, if we pack that cart with black powder and give it a kick...",

	"pes_woods_conversation_eight_01": "This interloper, then, that's scrobbled Isha. I mean ... I'm up for giving them a kicking, if you reckon it'll help.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_eight_02": "Alright ... so there'll be a bit of a bodyguard problem to deal with?",
	"pes_woods_conversation_eight_03": "I'm up for it, but I guess that's a 'no', yeah?",
	"pes_woods_conversation_five_01": "A scholar once told me that the Sisters of the Thorn were handmaidens of Isha. 'Course, he was drunk at the time.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_five_02": "What about Isha?",
	"pes_woods_conversation_seven_01": "So, Kerillian ... What happened to Isha? ",
	"pes_woods_conversation_seven_02": "Sorry, but you've got me curious now.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_six_01": "You were talking about Isha before.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_six_02": "Sore topic, then?",
	"pes_woods_conversation_six_03": "Much clearer, thanks.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_twentyeight_01": "Kerillian's a bit different these days, ain't she?",
	"pes_woods_conversation_twentyeight_02": "Yeah, but when we're talking about Kerillian, moderation ain't exactly the word, is it?",
	"pes_woods_conversation_twentynine_01": "Did she? I'm not so sure of that.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_twentyseven_01": "I know what you mean. Sometimes she seems normal ... well, normal for her ... but the rest? She gives me shivers.",
	"pes_woods_conversation_twentysix_01": "Noblest part? That sounded like a compliment ... or a Saltzpyre compliment, anyhow.",
	"pes_wood_elf_eaten_01": "Oi! That Chaos Spawn's gobbling down the Elf! Face like a bloody meat grinder.",
	"pes_wood_elf_eaten_02": "Taal, that Chaos Spawn's eating the Elf! We gotta stop that, or I'll never be sober again, alright?",
	"pes_wood_elf_eaten_03": "Kerillian got caught, and the Spawn's up to no good! We need to kill that thing even more now!",
	"pes_wood_elf_eaten_04": "Chaos Spawn grabbed Kerillian! Hey, Elf! Stay away from its mouth! And the other mouth.... and those... things!",
	"pes_wood_elf_eaten_05": "Monster-spawn-thing got a hold of Kerillian! I'd say its as good a time as any to kill it bloody dead, and spit on its corpse.",
	"pes_wood_elf_eaten_06": "Soddin tentacle-beast went for the Elf! Now we're going for it, in turn, alright! With bloody murder in our eyes!",
	"pes_wv_afternoon_rain_01": "Rain? I can feel my boots chafing already.",
	"pes_wv_afternoon_rain_02": "Ain't a war if it ain't raining, mark my words.",
	"pes_wv_dawn_rain_01": "Mark my words: if a day starts with rain, it ends with blisters.",
	"pes_wv_dawn_rain_02": "Not a nice way to start the morning: wet through and miserable.",
	"pes_wv_dawn_snow_01": "Brrrrr. Cold morning, ain't it? We'll warm up when the killing starts.",
	"pes_wv_dawn_snow_02": "You all laughed at me when I wanted another five minutes in bed. Bet you wish you'd listened now.",
	"pes_wv_dusk_rain_01": "Hooray. I *love* rain.",
	"pes_wv_dusk_rain_02": "I'm drenched already. What I need - what I really need - is someone to take it out on.",
	"pes_wv_dusk_snow_01": "Snow? Never mind. A bit of murder'll keep us toasty warm.",
	"pes_wv_dusk_snow_02": "I like snow. Makes the world look a nicer place. ",
	"pes_wv_dusk_storm_01": "Now, I'm not a fairweather fighter, but would nice weather be too much to ask?",
	"pes_wv_dusk_storm_02": "Raining again? Took me hours to get my clothes dry last time.",
	"pes_wv_midday_sunny_01": "This is more like it. Nothing like killing in the sunshine, as my old gran always said.",
	"pes_wv_midday_sunny_02": "What a lovely day. Let's spoil it for someone, shall we?",
	"pes_wv_midnight_clear_01": "Don't know about you, but an open sky always makes me feel dead small.",
	"pes_wv_midnight_clear_02": "Sky's nice tonight. She might do better to hide her face when we're about our business.",
	"pes_wv_midnight_fog_01": "Could be an army hidden in the mist ... just waiting for us to get cocky.",
	"pes_wv_midnight_fog_02": "Fine weather for an ambush. And not much bloody else.",
	"pes_wv_midnight_storm_01": "Can we come back in the morning? This is horrible.",
	"pes_wv_midnight_storm_02": "Who's clever idea was it to come out in this lot? What an 'orrible night."
