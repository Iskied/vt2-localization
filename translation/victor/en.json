That seems to be the way.","pwh_portals_follow_trail_04":"Let the Pactsworn rot in this village. Our battle lies beyond!","pwh_bastion_intro_line_c_01":"Indeed. We shall bring salvation to those who have been taken. Or mercy, if salvation is beyond our gift.","pwh_portals_conversation_two_01":"He's nothing but a tale. An excuse for wickedness, rather than a real adversary.","pwh_portals_portal_event_01":"What foolishness is this?","pwh_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_03":"The throne room is close, and our quarry laired within, I'm sure.","pwh_portals_portal_interact_two_02":"The generator still functions.","pwh_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_03":"Eternal? I think not!","pwh_generic_path_blocked_04":"Can we get through?","pwh_portals_objective_recap_04":"I'd sooner trust Sigmar than that... that... unintelligible rag!","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_04":"I spy a cage... and within, a living soul!","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_done_01":"The sorcerer is gone, and our way is clear.","pwh_portals_crypt_event_blood_02":"The blood of the slain gathers beneath our feet. We're... feeding it?","pwh_hub_lohner_conversation_two_01":"Then he should take care to stay out of the Reikland. I will not abide that necromancer's presence.","pwh_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_04":"The sorcerer considers himself heir to the legend of the Great Enchanter. We shall teach him otherwise!","pwh_hub_lohner_conversation_one_01":"It will keep... At least for now. I'm sure we will prevail without their aid.","pwh_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_04":"We draw close to the throne room. That cannot be happenstance.","pwh_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_03":"We must find and banish Nurgloth's daemon for this to truly end.","pwh_portals_kidnapped_traces_02":"See? Some of the villagers were dragged away. To Castle Drachenfels, no doubt.","pwh_portals_map_first_clue_01":"That statue. I've seen it before... on the map.","pwh_portals_crypt_event_hole_01":"A way out, at last!","pwh_portals_temple_event_04":"Hear that? Heretics seek our judgement!","pwh_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_03":"Sigmar, show me a path back to open skies.","pwh_portals_everyone_gone_04":"All gone! But our work continues! It must!","pwh_portals_enter_village_03":"The village lies before us, and a righteous task beckons.","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_02":"Prepare for judgement, witch!","pwh_portals_temple_event_01":"We've drawn the Pactsworn's interest. Be ready.","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_03":"The air grows thick with malice.","pwh_portals_the_temple_04":"The temple of Sigmar. Crumbling, but defiant.","pwh_generic_getting_dark_outside_04":"Sin falls as a shroud across truth's light.","pwh_portals_follow_trail_03":"We can do nothing more here! Onwards to Drachenfels!","pwh_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_03":"Do you see? The gargoyles have no heads.","pwh_castle_vo_traces_one_03":"Look at that filth! Heresy always betrays itself.","pwh_portals_portal_event_03":"The portal has come alive!","pwh_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_02":"Strange that the gargoyles lack for heads.","pwh_portals_memory_portals_01":"Pfah! Ratman trickery.","pwh_generic_search_progressing_02":"Is there another?","pwh_castle_vo_blood_pool_04":"Another cursed gatekeeper? No matter. The way is clear.","pwh_portals_help_search_04":"Idleness is the path to heresy! Find the map!","pwh_portals_objective_recap_01":"Curse that map for not being clearer. We shall trust to Sigmar for guidance.","pwh_generic_falling_01":"(scream)","pwh_portals_portal_interact_one_04":"It doesn't function... Or does it?","pwh_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_03":"We need a path back to the upper floors.","pwh_generic_door_locked_03":"The cursed thing is locked!","pwh_bastion_vo_search_cells_04":"If there are captives to be found, I will uncover them!","pwh_portals_memory_path_04":"My feet remember this path, though my memory drowns in murk.","pwh_generic_assemble_03":"To my side!","pwh_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_02":"Why do I have the sense that we have left something undone?","pwh_portals_crypt_event_hole_04":"An exit! Would that we had not sated the daemon to find it!","pwh_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_02":"Is there a way through this crypt?","pwh_portals_the_temple_02":"The temple lies just ahead!","pwh_portals_portal_interact_two_03":"Hark! It lives... After a fashion.","pwh_generic_success_02":"Sigmar guides us.","pwh_portals_village_raided_02":"We shall smite all who played a part in this desecration!","pwh_castle_vo_recognize_02":"I want to say that I've been here before, but I cannot be certain.","pwh_castle_vo_traces_one_02":"See? Our quarry leaves a trail like a slug.","pwh_portals_enter_village_04":"Hurry! I would have answers about this village's fate!","pwh_portals_village_raided_01":"I shall see the perpetrators brought to justice for their deeds!","pwh_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_04":"I see nothing save heretics begging for bloody chastisement.","pwh_portals_get_to_temple_02":"If Lohner spoke true, there is a map to a secret passage in the village temple.","pwh_portals_kidnapped_traces_04":"There... Signs of hope, perhaps? We shall see... at Castle Drachenfels!","pwh_generic_dark_03":"Sigmar! Guide my steps!","pwh_portals_conversation_five_02":"As do I, master dwarf. As do I.","pwh_generic_unexpected_event_03":"Oh, more surprises...","pwh_castle_vo_recognize_01":"Ah... This seems familiar.","pwh_castle_vo_traces_one_01":"Our quarry leaves a trail a blind man could follow.","pwh_generic_rain_02":"It's raining. Again!","pwh_portals_waystone_03":"The waystone! Let us hope Olesya can return us to this place.","pwh_castle_vo_blockage_03":"Clear a path! Vengeance will not be stymied!","pwh_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_04":"We must return to the upper floors. At once!","pwh_generic_cold_inside_01":"How is it so cold in here?","pwh_portals_portal_interact_three_04":"Leave it alone! Do you want more ratmen?","pwh_archdaemon_response_03":"Silence!","pwh_bastion_vo_exiting_pwh_bastion_02":"The sorcerer will die by my hand... But we should return rested.","pwh_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_01":"No! You will die and your body be a feast for the crows!","pwh_generic_objective_complete_03":"It is finished.","pwh_bastion_vo_search_cells_02":"Scour these cells. Leave no stone unturned!","pwh_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_01":"So falls Nurgloth the Eternal!","pwh_portals_stairs_02":"Keep... Climbing...","pwh_generic_reaction_action_01":"What was that?","pwh_portals_village_raided_04":"Slaughter and mayhem! Our presence is indeed needed here!","pwh_portals_stairs_01":"So... Many... Stairs...","pwh_castle_vo_landed_02":"This... was not my finest hour.","pwh_castle_vo_hello_01":"I distrust this quiet.","pwh_portals_map_second_clue_02":"If the map speaks true, these statues guard the entrance.","pwh_castle_vo_halls_03":"We are back on course... At least, I believe so.","pwh_generic_dark_01":"I can barely see!","pwh_bastion_intro_line_b_02":"It may be there are dungeons below. If so, we shall discover them.","pwh_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_01":"The gargoyles are headless. I doubt they were fashioned thus.","pwh_portals_enter_village_02":"Aha! The village. I will have answers, depend upon it!","pwh_generic_search_start_03":"There must be some clue.","pwh_castle_vo_door_open_04":"A welcome, is it? Somehow I doubt their warm regards.","pwh_portals_find_map_01":"Be swift! Find the map!","pwh_generic_cold_outside_03":"I feel a chill in my bones.","pwh_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_01":"It would seem our next task is to get back upstairs.","pwh_castle_vo_find_a_way_up_02":"(sigh) Not a glorious start. We have to get back upstairs.","pwh_portals_raid_trace_01":"Signs of a struggle...","pwh_generic_falling_03":"(scream)","pwh_portals_portal_interact_three_02":"Well done! More skaven!","pwh_archdaemon_response_overheard_04":"What ails thee?","pwh_castle_vo_halls_01":"I believe we are back in the castle.","pwh_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_02":"I have no memory of this area.","pwh_generic_success_03":"The righteous will always triumph.","pwh_portals_village_raided_03":"Lohner's information was accurate! It is ever thus when heresy abounds!","pwh_bastion_intro_line_a_02":"This fortification stands in our way. We shall penetrate its secrecy and forge on.","pwh_archdaemon_response_04":"Blessed Sigmar, shelter me...","pwh_portals_find_survivors_01":"Are there no survivors?","pwh_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_03":"We shall keep moving, and pray for those we have failed.","pwh_castle_vo_drop_down_04":"Must we fall again? My bruises have bruises.","pwh_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_03":"Save whomever you can!","pwh_generic_door_locked_01":"It's locked!","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_finale_02":"The rest are in Sigmar's keeping now. It falls to us to avenge them... but against what?","pwh_portals_intro_line_b_01":"It may yet be that we are too late.","pwh_gameplay_hearing_a_standard_bearer_06":"Hear that chant? 'Tis a flag bearer that approaches.","pwh_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_02":"A ritual? Sigmar calls us to mighty deeds!","pwh_generic_success_04":"Success!","pwh_generic_search_complete_02":"This is it!","pwh_castle_conversation_eight_01":"Really? Were they... accomplished thespians?","pwh_generic_assemble_04":"Come! At once!","pwh_bastion_conversation_five_02":"So you also believe?","pwh_portals_temple_event_02":"Here they come. Meet them with righteous steel.","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_missile_03":"Blessed Sigmar! The rancid visitation follows my every move!","pwh_portals_trail_found_04":"Castle Drachenfels lies beyond the trail. I smell its corruption.","pwh_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_02":"Seek the rest! I shall see them freed!","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_courtyard_03":"See that cage? A captive yet lives!","pwh_castle_conversation_ten_02":"If Sigmar wills it.","pwh_generic_cold_inside_04":"My every breath is full of ice.","pwh_portals_crypt_event_blood_03":"The room feasts on blood! Was this the daemon's plan?","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_03":"Sigmar! Lend me the strength to smite this witch!","pwh_bastion_vo_possessed_01":"They fight as though possessed!","pwh_portals_enter_village_01":"This must be the village. Let us see what heresy is afoot!","pwh_castle_vo_door_open_03":"Could they show their intent to trap us more plainly?","pwh_castle_intro_line_a_02":"It matters not where the sorcerer hides! We shall seek him out!","pwh_portals_memory_path_01":"I remember this path...","pwh_castle_vo_vista_02":"Moon-cast shadows cannot hide this fortress' evils.","pwh_portals_portal_interact_three_01":"Marvellous! Did we not already have enough skaven?","pwh_archdaemon_response_overheard_01":"What was that?","pwh_portals_event_missing_gargoyle_heads_04":"The gargoyles' heads. I've seen this trick played once before.","pwh_portals_intro_line_c_01":"Lohner spoke of a map that would be useful, should Drachenfels be our ultimate destination.","pwh_castle_vo_door_open_02":"It seems we are expected.","pwh_portals_memory_portals_04":"It seems we are to be spared this particular brand of skaven 'genius'.","pwh_portals_map_second_clue_01":"These statues... Yes! These conceal the secret entrance!","pwh_castle_vo_this_way_02":"To my side. At once!","pwh_bastion_conversation_two_02":"Stop twisting my words! You know precisely what I meant!","pwh_portals_waystone_04":"We must gird ourselves before proceeding. The waystone will return us here, when all is prepared.","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_01":"The sorcerer is weakening!","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_darkness_04":"Darkness shall not hide thee, heretics!","pwh_generic_search_progressing_08":"We're closer, but not yet done.","pwh_portals_portal_interact_one_02":"It would be unwise to interfere.","pwh_generic_reaction_sound_03":"That sound...","pwh_castle_vo_vista_04":"It looks... almost peaceful.","pwh_generic_search_progressing_06":"Simple trickery, not worthy of our time. Find another.","pwh_portals_trail_found_03":"Keep to the trail. The castle lies ahead.","pwh_castle_vo_drop_down_02":"Another drop? Is there truly no other way out?","pwh_gameplay_hearing_a_standard_bearer_combat_06":"That chant! A flag bearer comes!","pwh_castle_vo_blood_pool_02":"Is this the abode of another gatekeeper daemon?","pwh_castle_vo_meet_sorcerer_02":"Your rule ends now!","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_sorcerer_04":"I shall see you hurled into oblivion, witch!","pwh_portals_temple_locked_03":"The door is stout and sealed. ","pwh_portals_map_first_clue_03":"Aha! That statue! That's on the map.","pwh_castle_conversation_ten_01":"More than my share... but never enough.","pwh_portals_kidnapped_traces_01":"Not all died. We may yet be able to offer salvation. ","pwh_castle_vo_throne_room_approach_02":"It can be no coincidence that the throne room is near.","pwh_portals_memory_portals_03":"The machinery is inert, thank Sigmar.","pwh_portals_crypt_event_demon_voice_02":"Reveal thyself, daemon! Face a righteous soul!","pwh_generic_reaction_action_03":"What is that?","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_done_03":"The sorcerer retreats. We have won this round.","pwh_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_03":"I do not intend to spend my life trapped in this crypt!","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_finale_03":"This slaughter was to purpose. The blood has called forth power. I must know its nature.","pwh_bastion_vo_exiting_pwh_bastion_04":"The sorcerer will not escape. We will return to end his blight.","pwh_generic_cold_outside_04":"Faith will keep me warm.","pwh_portals_help_search_01":"Cease thy tardiness! Find the map!","pwh_generic_cold_outside_01":"Why is it so cold out here?","pwh_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_01":"We should head for the surface.","pwh_generic_objective_complete_04":"We're done.","pwh_portals_get_to_temple_03":"We must reach the temple! Lohner spoke of a secret passage, and a map.","pwh_castle_vo_landed_04":"Let us not speak of this moment again.","pwh_castle_vo_enter_03":"We must proceed deeper into the castle. That door, perhaps?","pwh_portals_crypt_exit_01":"A burdensome journey, but we are inside.","pwh_generic_objective_complete_02":"Tis accomplished.","pwh_generic_reaction_action_04":"What now?","pwh_generic_unexpected_event_04":"Blessed Sigmar, give me strength.","pwh_castle_conversation_four_02":"Yes. If you like.","pwh_portals_find_survivors_04":"Do any villagers yet live?","pwh_portals_help_search_03":"Must I search alone? ","pwh_portals_map_second_clue_04":"These blasphemous statues conceal the entrance.","pwh_portals_waystone_02":"Now we have located the waystone, Olesya can return us here.","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_gate_02":"Is that squiggle the gate, or has the ink run? Is that a path around?","pwh_castle_vo_this_way_04":"Tarry not! Our duty lies before us!","pwh_castle_vo_vista_03":"The valley slumbers, ignorant of the evil lurking amongst the crags.","pwh_portals_waystone_01":"With the waystone found, we can return rested.","pwh_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_04":"I see no sign of captives. We shall have to press on.","pwh_castle_vo_blood_pool_03":"Do not touch the pool. There may be a daemon watching.","pwh_bastion_intro_line_a_01":"We seem to have reached some manner of outer bastion. We must find a way through.","pwh_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_04":"A way in is worthless if there's no way out.","pwh_castle_vo_landed_03":"A long drop. Fortunately, my... pride broke the fall.","pwh_castle_vo_this_way_01":"Cease thy tarrying!","pwh_generic_door_locked_02":"It won't open!","pwh_gameplay_hearing_a_standard_bearer_04":"Hold your tongues... That is a flag bearer.","pwh_castle_vo_blood_pool_01":"At least this is one pool we shall not have to fill.","pwh_generic_falling_02":"(scream)","pwh_generic_search_start_04":"We can't give up now.","pwh_bastion_vo_courtyard_first_villager_01":"You heard the fellow! Find the others! ","pwh_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_03":"I should feel triumphant... And yet I am haunted by... something.","pwh_bastion_conversation_nine_01":"Lohner's artist? What is she to me?","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_road_02":"There must be landmarks somewhere...","pwh_portals_raid_trace_04":"Better to die defiant, than beg heretics for mercy.","pwh_portals_conversation_seven_02":"Impossible!","pwh_portals_find_survivors_02":"Stay vigilant! There may yet be faithful in need of aid!","pwh_castle_vo_crypt_not_discovered_01":"We have triumphed... And yet I feel our work is incomplete.","pwh_castle_vo_trap_switch_02":"Perhaps we should not go pulling every switch we encounter?","pwh_bastion_vo_caves_01":"A vast cavern. One that has doubtless seen its share of heresy.","pwh_portals_trail_found_02":"Follow the trail. We'll work out the rest as we travel.","pwh_bastion_vo_head_to_surface_04":"Seek the open air. There is an unholy stench in this place.","pwh_portals_follow_trail_01":"Leave the village behind! Our battle lies ahead.","pwh_bastion_vo_caves_03":"A labyrinth beckons. We must keep together!","pwh_castle_vo_do_not_recognize_04":"Curse this place! The corridors are different to before!","pwh_generic_search_progressing_04":"That wasn't enough. There must be something else.","pwh_generic_objective_complete_01":"Tis done.","pwh_generic_search_complete_04":"So, it was as simple as that, eh?","pwh_bastion_intro_line_c_02":"We will leave no stone uncovered, and no drop of blood unshed. On!","pwh_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_01":"Did you hear? An unholy ritual, fuelled by blood! NOT WHILE I DRAW BREATH!","pwh_gameplay_hearing_a_standard_bearer_02":"Listen... A flag bearer comes.","pwh_portals_conversation_seven_01":"I keep telling you, Kruber, there is no Drachenfels.","pwh_portals_everyone_gone_02":"Curse our slowness! The fiends have emptied the village.","pwh_castle_vo_secret_door_03":"A secret door? This castle is full of surprises.","pwh_portals_get_out_03":"They seek to stall us!","pwh_portals_find_map_02":"The map must be here somewhere!","pwh_generic_search_complete_01":"Aha!","pwh_generic_cold_inside_02":"So... cold...","pwh_portals_stairs_04":"By the Hammer, do these stairs ever end?","pwh_generic_getting_dark_outside_02":"The light fades.","pwh_portals_temple_bell_tower_01":"Perhaps the belltower offers an entrance.","pwh_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_04":"He falls! A heretic's dreams are nothing to Sigmar's holy wrath!","pwh_castle_vo_recognize_03":"I've been here before.","pwh_generic_reaction_sound_01":"I heard that!","pwh_portals_crypt_exit_03":"I'm sure there were easier ways to do that...","pwh_castle_vo_enter_01":"This way appears unbarred.","pwh_generic_reaction_action_02":"Eh?","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_gate_04":"Hold a moment. I think I see how that gate fits with the map. And another path!","pwh_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_01":"Nurgloth was but the puppet. We must enter the crypt and slay his patron if this is to count.","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_road_04":"Curse this map! Nothing looks as it should.","pwh_bastion_conversation_one_01":"How many times must I tell you, Kruber? There never was a Great Enchanter.","pwh_bastion_conversation_two_01":"Living in this castle's blighted shadow is a test of righteousness... or perhaps common sense.","pwh_castle_vo_secret_door_04":"A secret door. Let us see where it leads.","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_gate_03":"That! That's the gate on the map... I think. So that is a different path?","pwh_bastion_conversation_five_01":"The others set too much store in the legend of Constant Drachenfels, but not you and I, Master Dwarf. We recognise the truth.","pwh_portals_memory_path_03":"We have walked this bloodied path before, I think.","pwh_portals_conversation_six_01":"Why, because it is the haunt of heretics and blasphemers, naturally. Many small evils add up to a single, vast abomination, when viewed through history's lens.","pwh_castle_vo_crypt_discovered_04":"We are not finished. The daemon Nurgloth summoned lurks in the crypt. We must banish it!","pwh_hub_lohner_conversation_five_01":"I contemplate our next move. We cannot afford rash action.","pwh_archdaemon_response_02":"I am deaf to your accusations!","pwh_gameplay_hearing_a_standard_bearer_05":"A flag bearer draws near...","pwh_portals_find_map_04":"Now, to find the map!","pwh_portals_the_map_02":"This map is little more than gibberish! However...","pwh_generic_search_start_02":"Search for means to progress.","pwh_bastion_vo_search_cells_03":"Search this prison!","pwh_portals_find_survivors_03":"Did no one survive this horror?","pwh_castle_vo_drop_down_03":"It seems our fate to fall this day.","pwh_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_04":"Gird thyselves! The real battle begins once we're inside!","pwh_portals_crypt_event_blood_01":"The floor's filling with blood!","pwh_castle_vo_search_again_01":"Now, where is that heretic sorcerer?","pwh_castle_vo_drop_down_01":"Another drop? I'm still sore from the last one.","pwh_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_02":"We are victorious. Another pretender to Castle Drachenfels lies dead!","pwh_castle_conversation_twelve_01":"Then you've even more reason to ignore it.","pwh_bastion_vo_no_prisoners_02":"We shall have to press on. There is nothing here for us.","pwh_castle_vo_approaching_throne_room_03":"Prepare thyselves! I sense the sorcerer's foul presence!","pwh_castle_intro_line_c_01":"Nevertheless, we shall prevail!","pwh_bastion_vo_exiting_pwh_bastion_01":"Our work is not yet done. We will return and end this sorcerer's foul existence.","pwh_portals_map_first_clue_04":"The statue! Sigmar be praised, I know where we are now!","pwh_portals_temple_locked_02":"The door is sealed. We must find another way in.","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_vista_02":"Praise Sigmar that the Great Enchanter is gone... If he ever existed at all, of course.","pwh_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_01":"Curses! Where are they?","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_done_04":"So much for the daemon-spawned might!","pwh_portals_stairs_03":"Blessed Sigmar, how many stairs?","pwh_portals_crypt_event_entering_crypt_01":"A crypt? Is there another exit?","pwh_castle_vo_hello_04":"Deserted? What trickery is this?","pwh_generic_dark_04":"My vision is impaired!","pwh_portals_temple_bell_tower_02":"Try the belltower. We can't linger here.","pwh_portals_the_temple_03":"Sigmar's temple. Always a welcome sight, and now more than ever.","pwh_castle_vo_trap_switch_01":"Have a care... After what happened before...","pwh_castle_vo_blockage_01":"The path is blocked! Find a way through!","pwh_portals_the_temple_01":"There! Holy ground!","pwh_archdaemon_response_overheard_03":"Are you sick?","pwh_portals_temple_locked_04":"Locked. Sigmar tests us even now.","pwh_portals_get_out_01":"We cannot afford delay!","pwh_portals_portal_interact_one_01":"Don't meddle.","pwh_portals_map_first_clue_02":"That statue's marked on the map.","pwh_bastion_vo_courtyard_done_03":"Our course is revealed! A blasphemous blood ritual, ours to unmake!","pwh_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_03":"These chambers go on and on. All empty.","pwh_portals_secret_entrance_gate_opens_01":"There! Praise Sigmar, but I thought we'd never manage it.","pwh_hub_lohner_conversation_four_01":"If all wizards relied more on faith, the Empire would never fall. Alas, most cleave to their own trickeries alone.","pwh_castle_vo_sorcerer_slain_03":"Another heretic's blood stains the halls of Castle Drachenfels!","pwh_generic_assemble_01":"Come here!","pwh_bastion_vo_possessed_03":"Power has driven them mad!","pwh_portals_objective_recap_03":"That map is near worthless. Sigmar will show the way.","pwh_castle_vo_enter_02":"Through here? The way is not sealed.","pwh_castle_vo_trap_switch_03":"Have a care! That switch may be another trap!","pwh_bastion_conversation_nine_02":"I don't follow. ","pwh_castle_vo_landed_01":"When I recount the memoir of my life, I shall perhaps draw a veil over this part.","pwh_portals_get_out_02":"Fight through them!","pwh_bastion_vo_entrance_03":"A tunnel through the firmament. Let us investigate!","pwh_bastion_vo_finale_tiring_03":"Hah! His daemonic vigour ebbs!","pwh_archdaemon_response_01":"Leave me alone!","pwh_bastion_vo_inside_cellblock_02":"Sigmar guide my steps. Bring me to those in need.","pwh_bastion_vo_search_cells_01":"Prison cells! Search them all!","pwh_generic_search_progressing_07":"There must be another. Keep searching.","pwh_generic_path_blocked_02":"Find a way through!","pwh_gameplay_hearing_a_standard_bearer_03":"Hark! A flag bearer.","pwh_portals_pwh_castle_vista_03":"I'm told the Order has torn down those stones many times, but the castle always returns.","pwh_portals_get_to_temple_04":"On! To the temple! There is a map within, and a secret passage to uncover!","pwh_bastion_vo_caves_02":"It seems the castle sprawls even further belowground than above.","pwh_portals_intro_line_b_02":"Alas, we may already be too late.","pwh_bastion_vo_entering_finale_01":"We are too late for these others. Their blood fuels something blasphemous. I would find out exactly what.","pwh_bastion_vo_possessed_02":"These foes possess bleak strength!","pwh_fleur_conversation_nineteen_01":"To paint your official portrait, so I gather.","pwh_fleur_conversation_nine_02":"The same side as Bretonnians? I think not. Some of them actually bathe.","pwh_fleur_conversation_twelve_01":"So... This 'Lady' the Bretonnians worship. She's real?","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentysix_01":"Know you much about Bretonnians, wizard?","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentyfive_03":"Doing what, exactly?","pwh_fleur_conversation_twelve_02":"And full of seductive wiles, I'll be bound.","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentysix_02":"Yes, I'm sure... but in matters martial?","pwh_fleur_conversation_ten_02":"Must you keep using that ridiculous accent?","pwh_fleur_conversation_ten_03":"It doesn't matter.","pwh_fleur_conversation_nine_01":"I want you to know, Kruber, that I think no less of you for your recent ... defection.","pwh_fleur_conversation_nine_03":"It's like I never knew you at all.","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentythree_01":"It hadn't escaped me.","pwh_fleur_conversation_eleven_03":"This is preposterous!","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentythree_02":"Did you have a point to make, Master Dwarf?","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentyfive_02":"Elf...","pwh_fleur_conversation_eleven_01":"Things being the way they are, Kruber, I wonder if I can trust you any longer?","pwh_fleur_conversation_twentyfive_01":"What is this 'Old Alliance' of which I've heard Kruber speak?","pwh_fleur_conversation_eleven_02":"What?!","pwh_fleur_conversation_ten_01":"Kruber, I've been meaning to talk to you about something?","pwh_whisper_conversation_twelve_01":"About Castle Drachenfels...","pwh_comet_conversation_two_01":"And what of the theological considerations?","pwh_comet_conversation_eight_01":"With the comet's return, elf, you'll finally witness the might of Sigmar!","pwh_whispers_conversation_one_01":"It's... nothing.

You will see.","pwh_comet_conversation_nine_02":"I don't believe it. You're as bad as the others.","pwh_comet_conversation_six_02":"Not always. Not always.","pwh_comet_conversation_one_01":"It speaks to dire times ahead, but promises victory.","pwh_comet_conversation_ten_01":"Very well. Coming, dear lady!","pwh_whisper_conversation_twelve_03":"Hmph.","pwh_comet_conversation_eight_02":"One day you'll pay for your insolence!","pwh_whisper_conversation_twelve_02":"We gain nothing by further discussion?","pwh_whisper_conversation_six_01":"What! Of course not! I am a righteous man, proof against such creatures!","pwh_cog_conversation_twentyone_01":"Do you find satisfaction in the art of creation, Goreksson?","pwh_cog_conversation_nineteen_02":"Indeed, there is space for them all in Sigmar's shadow.","pwh_cog_conversation_twenty_03":"Yes?","pwh_cog_conversation_nineteen_01":"I imagine you'll be invoking Morgrim a lot more now, Master Dwarf?","pwh_cog_conversation_twentytwo_02":"Indeed it is.

He sounds like a stalwart soul.","pwh_cog_conversation_twentyfour_01":"Perhaps you should use your newfound standing with the Engineer's Guild to get our weapons improved?","pwh_cog_conversation_twenty_01":"It still seems strange to me that there is a God of Engineers.","pwh_cog_conversation_twenty_02":"And what is that, pray?","pwh_cog_conversation_twentyfour_03":"But what of structure! Discipline! The judgement of one's peers? You have no one against whom to measure yourself!","pwh_cog_conversation_twentythree_03":"You see! Precisely the proper role model in this wicked world of ours.","pwh_cog_conversation_twentyone_02":"Who told you-- Lohner, I suppose?","pwh_cog_conversation_twentytwo_01":"Do you plan to create many mighty weapons with which to chastise the Pactsworn?"}
