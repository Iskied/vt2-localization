	"pwh_castle_vo_secret_door_02": "It's only a secret door. Thank Sigmar.",
	"pwh_castle_vo_secret_door_03": "A secret door? This castle is full of surprises.",

	"pwh_cemetary_intro_b_02": "Show respect. This is a holy place.",
	"pwh_cemetary_intro_c_01": "We will expunge this pestilence. This I swear by the Heldenhammer!",

	"pwh_chaos_war_camp_intro_b_01": "This is an opportunity we must seize! The fiend will never be more vulnerable.",
	"pwh_chaos_war_camp_intro_b_02": "The champion has lowered his guard by lashing out in anger. It shall be his last mistake.",
	"pwh_chaos_war_camp_intro_c_01": "Stout hearts and steady sword-arms will see us victorious. Sigmar wills it!",

	"pwh_cog_conversation_nineteen_01": "I imagine you'll be invoking Morgrim a lot more now, Master Dwarf?",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_nineteen_02": "Indeed, there is space for them all in Sigmar's shadow.",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentyfour_01": "Perhaps you should use your newfound standing with the Engineer's Guild to get our weapons improved?",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentyfour_03": "But what of structure! Discipline! The judgement of one's peers? You have no one against whom to measure yourself!",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentyone_01": "Do you find satisfaction in the art of creation, Goreksson?",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentyone_02": "Who told you-- Lohner, I suppose?",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentythree_01": "I heard Lohner speak of your father some time ago. He sounds like a stalwart soul.",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentythree_03": "You see! Precisely the proper role model in this wicked world of ours.",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentytwo_01": "Do you plan to create many mighty weapons with which to chastise the Pactsworn?",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twentytwo_02": "Indeed it is. That which is flawed can never truly be righteous.",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twenty_01": "It still seems strange to me that there is a God of Engineers.",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twenty_02": "And what is that, pray?",
	"pwh_cog_conversation_twenty_03": "Yes?",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_eight_01": "With the comet's return, elf, you'll finally witness the might of Sigmar!",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_eight_02": "One day you'll pay for your insolence!",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_nine_01": "Surely you at least rejoice in the twin-tailed comet's return, Kruber?",

	"pwh_comet_conversation_nine_03": "You will see. You will see.",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_one_01": "It speaks to dire times ahead, but promises victory.",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_one_02": "Certainly! ... If we deserve his aid...",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_seven_01": "The twin-tailed comet rules the skies, a stalwart alliance of dwarfs and men stands against Chaos. It's like history's repeating itself.",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_seven_02": "So you're not up to the challenge?",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_six_01": "Fear not for the future, Sigmar sends his twin-tailed comet as herald to his coming!",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_six_02": "Not always. Not always.",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_ten_01": "Very well. Coming, dear lady!",
	"pwh_comet_conversation_two_01": "And what of the theological considerations?",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_done_01": "Beastmen! So my suspicions were correct! What has drawn them here?",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_done_02": "Beastmen! Foul mutants, cursed from birth by their parents' sins. We must exterminate them all!",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_done_03": "So this was the work of beastmen! How are they tied into Lohner's worries? I must know!",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_done_04": "Beastmen are ever the herald to greater evils. We must continue our search.",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_interactable_01": "A rat ogre slain by some crude weapon. I doubt the killer means us any better.",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_interactable_02": "A rat ogre, slain? No small feat.",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_interactable_03": "This rat ogre has been dead for some time. But at whose hand?",
	"pwh_crater_ambush_interactable_04": "The blade is too crude for any artful smith. This bodes ill.",
	"pwh_crater_arena_end_01": "We... We live? Sigmar be praised! But why does the air feel so strange?",
	"pwh_crater_arena_end_02": "We survived! Another victory for Sigmar!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_end_03": "Righteousness triumphs! But something does not feel right.",
	"pwh_crater_arena_end_04": "Victory? Yes! And we live to punish heretics another day!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_01": "That standard! It grounds the magic! Destroy it!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_02": "That standard. Hack it apart!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_02_01": "Another standard! Destroy it!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_02_02": "Destroy that standard! Don't let them stabilise the ritual!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_02_03": "Another! Hack it down!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_02_04": "They're not giving up! Destroy that standard!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_03": "The standard acts as a grounding rod. Destroy it!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_standard_04": "The standard! Destroy it!",
	"pwh_crater_arena_waystone_01": "Something remains amiss. Perhaps Lohner can provide explanation.",
	"pwh_crater_arena_waystone_02": "We can do no more here. It may be that Lohner has answers.",
	"pwh_crater_arena_waystone_03": "Back to the keep! This has been a bloody day, but one full of worthy deeds.",
	"pwh_crater_arena_waystone_04": "For a moment, I felt... It matters not. We should leave.",
	"pwh_crater_bridge_sighted_01": "I see a way across the chasm. Press on!",
	"pwh_crater_bridge_sighted_02": "That tree may ease our passage of the chasm.",
	"pwh_crater_bridge_sighted_03": "Nature provides our bridge. Though we should tread with care.",
	"pwh_crater_bridge_sighted_04": "See? We can cross yonder... providing we keep our eyes on the path, and not the rocks below.",
	"pwh_crater_climb_top_01": "Hark at those voices! Foul work afoot, I'll be bound.",
	"pwh_crater_climb_top_02": "Heretical chanting! My blood boils to hear it!",
	"pwh_crater_climb_top_03": "I hear voices raised in dark praise! A ritual! And one we shall destroy!",
	"pwh_crater_climb_top_04": "Hark! The beasts make chant to their blasphemous masters. We shall end it! We shall!",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_nine_01": "I've seen no definite proof either way. My view is that it doesn't matter, so long as they bleed.",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_six_01": "The beastmen are a plague, brewed by weakness and faltering resolve. A good parent would kill a mutant child, not offer it up to the woods and the iniquities of Chaos.",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_six_02": "Misplaced affection is of no protection against the Dark Gods, Goreksson. And faltering hearts have ever been the Empire's greatest weakness.",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_ten_01": "Should I die, Kruber, I'd like you to have my sword of office.",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_ten_02": "No. So they think that I liked you.",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_three_01": "These beastmen are more than mere monsters. ",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_three_02": "They are man's corruption made manifest.",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_two_01": "Beastmen! As if there wasn't already enough work for righteous souls!",
	"pwh_crater_conversation_two_02": "I have but one pair of hands, and they are multitudes. How does one man stay afloat on such seas?",
	"pwh_crater_devastation_01": "So much devastation. As if some uncaring hand had smote the hillside.",
	"pwh_crater_devastation_02": "We must be getting closer, though it is hard to tell with the ground in such turmoil.",
	"pwh_crater_devastation_03": "The villagers must have invited this devastation. Sinfulness and damnation are ever heralds of destruction.",
	"pwh_crater_devastation_04": "Onwards! The heart of the crater cannot be far! Sigmar will guide us!",
	"pwh_crater_forest_ascent_top_01": "More come with every step, but we will press on! Through the mountain, Lohner said.",
	"pwh_crater_forest_ascent_top_02": "Look for a way through the mountains! We must reach the crater.",
	"pwh_crater_forest_ascent_top_03": "With every step, it seems more and more that Lohner was right to be worried. We must find a way through.",
	"pwh_crater_forest_ascent_top_04": "No more tarrying! We must find a way through to the impact site!",
	"pwh_crater_intro_banter_a_01": "This is likely a waste of time. Curse Lohner and his vagueness.",
	"pwh_crater_intro_banter_a_02": "All this distance, and little hint of why.",
	"pwh_crater_intro_banter_b_01": "If only Lohner would share his suspicions. I suspect he knows more than he's saying.",
	"pwh_crater_intro_banter_b_02": "We shall have to trust that Lohner knows his business. If he does not, I shall have... words.",
	"pwh_crater_intro_banter_c_01": "On! Let us get this over with.",
	"pwh_crater_intro_banter_c_02": "Proceed, but remain vigilant. Even if this is a wild goose chase, there will likely be danger afoot.",
	"pwh_crater_plan_banter_a_01": "I... think it may be time for desperate measures. The beastmen are siphoning the warpstone's heretical energies. If we disrupt their ritual...",
	"pwh_crater_plan_banter_a_02": "Beastmen are crude beings. Their ritual will be slipshod and easily disrupted. If we do so...",
	"pwh_crater_plan_banter_b_01": "...it might birth an explosion to destroy both the beastmen and the warpstone. And as for us...",
	"pwh_crater_plan_banter_b_02": "...intemperate magic will break free, consuming both them and the warpstone. Yes! This could work, but...",
	"pwh_crater_plan_banter_c_01": "...it will be a righteous death. Better than most earn. I am content. On!",
	"pwh_crater_plan_banter_c_02": "...if we are slain, we die in righteous cause. What man could wish for better?",
	"pwh_crater_rim_vista_01": "This is worse than I feared. That meteor is too large for us to safely claim, even if we could fight our way to it.",
	"pwh_crater_rim_vista_02": "Sigmar! This is intolerable. An army of beastmen, a warpstone meteor too large to carry... What is a righteous man to do?",
	"pwh_crater_rim_vista_03": "That meteor is too large to carry, and the beastmen too many to kill. We need another plan.",
	"pwh_crater_rim_vista_04": "We cannot recover a warpstone shard that size, not without our flesh boiling and our minds collapsing. We need a new course.",
	"pwh_crater_tracking_camp_01": "I see skaven in abundance, but this camp is not theirs.",
	"pwh_crater_tracking_camp_02": "Ratmen will pick over any leavings, but I do not believe them the orchestrators of all this.",
	"pwh_crater_tracking_camp_03": "Don't be fooled by the presence of the ratmen. This is not their work.",
	"pwh_crater_tracking_camp_04": "Skaven abound, but when do they not in recent days?",
	"pwh_crater_vista_reveal_01": "There! The skies seethe with magic. What devilry is this?",
	"pwh_crater_vista_reveal_02": "Blessed Sigmar! The skies! Little wonder the beastmen were drawn here.",
	"pwh_crater_vista_reveal_03": "Such ruin! And above it all, the skies seethe with raw magic!",
	"pwh_crater_vista_reveal_04": "By the Hammer! The skies are overwhelmed by magic! The beastmen will be at the heart of it!",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_intro_01": "Could it be...? Yes, a warpstone meteor. We see the aftermath of its strike. We must investigate further.",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_intro_02": "From the colour of the heavens, I suspect the meteor was no ordinary rock, but warpstone! We must keep going.",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_intro_03": "Warpstone is known to plunge from the skies, spreading destruction and damnation in its wake. We cannot let the beastmen claim it.",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_intro_04": "A warpstone meteor! It must be. Little else could cause such ruin. We must recover it, before more harm is caused.",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_tree_push_01": "Another chasm... Perhaps we can make our own bridge?",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_tree_push_02": "Another perilous drop. We need a bridge.",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_tree_push_03": "We must find a way to get across... Perhaps that tree?",
	"pwh_crater_wasteland_tree_push_04": "It seems we must once again tread a timber path.",
	"pwh_crawl_cheers_01": "Cheers!",
	"pwh_crawl_cheers_02": "For Sigmar, Karl-Franz, and the Silver Hammer!",

	"pwh_crawl_conversation_one_01": "You know, I never wanted to be a witch hunter...",

	"pwh_gameplay_response_174": "As you wish. Perhaps it is time the fight was taken to the Chaos Realm!",

	"pwh_gameplay_response_180": "That foul mutant stood no chance against my steel.",
	"pwh_gameplay_response_181": "But such work is its own reward, Kruber.",
	"pwh_gameplay_response_182": "It was once a man, and now a flesh puppet of Chaos. It deserved worse.",
	"pwh_gameplay_response_183": "I'd say you've been careful enough for six or seven such beasts.",

	"pwh_gameplay_response_19": "If your squawking wasn't so distracting...",
	"pwh_gameplay_response_190": "As it should. This world has no room for Spawn of the Gods.",

	"pwh_level_bell_spotting_02": "It seems we are on the correct course. There it is!",
	"pwh_level_bell_spotting_03": "The bell! Alas, we still have a way to go. I want more pace, more faith and more death!",
	"pwh_level_bell_spotting_04": "The bell draws nearer. Press on! Bleed the pact-sworn horde!",
	"pwh_level_bell_vista_01": "Helmgart. Wreathed in storm, pleading to be avenged.",
	"pwh_level_bell_vista_02": "T'would be a fine view, if not for this bothersome storm of suspicable loyalty.",
	"pwh_level_bell_vista_03": "The storm shrouds Helmgart, and the perfidy within.",
	"pwh_level_bell_vista_04": "If it is too late to save this town, which I fear, we still fight to save the rest.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_01": "Seek the Blightreaper! Find that unholy blade!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_02": "The Blightreaper must be here!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_03": "Find the Blightreaper! We have come too far to be denied!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_artefact_04": "Where is that cursed sword? Look everywhere!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_blocked_01": "Curses! The way is blocked!",

	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_bogenauer_02": "The locals worship Bögenauer. But who trusts a god who cannot sustain a priesthood?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_bogenauer_03": "The folk of this place worship the god Bögenauer, a deity of scant power and little renown elsewhere.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_bogenauer_04": "Despite local fervour, Bögenauer is no god, but a merchant’s idle fancy.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_01": "Light the brazier!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_02": "Flame, like faith, is best shared.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_03": "Set light to the brazier, and quickly!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_braziers_04": "The brazier! Set it alight!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_01": "Dead? An ill fate. Sigmar will receive you in glory, old friend.",

	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_03": "Martyrdom has ever been the reward of the faithful. Ascend with honour, my friend.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_dead_priest_04": "Slain? You deserved better, old friend. What are you staring at? We have work to do.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_01": "Sacrilege! What has been done to this holy place?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_02": "Filth! Corruption! The holy walls slighted! Blasphemy without end!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_03": "The sword’s blight has consumed this place. Even Sigmar’s blessing cannot prevail.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_defiled_04": "This... This should not be possible...",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_01": "Now! Make for the waystone! We must be gone!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_02": "It is past time we departed. Lohner can deal with the Blightreaper.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_03": "Now we must only find the waystone. A simple task, for such righteous souls as we.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_escape_04": "Go! Let us begone!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_find_priest_key_01": "Father Kraussman will have the key. We need only find him.",

	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_01": "Hah! We have it!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_02": "Have a care. Do not fall prey to the daemon-blade’s whispers.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_03": "We have the sword. Steel your souls against its whispered malice.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_found_artefact_04": "This is what we sought. With it gone, Bögenhafen may yet recover.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_01": "A three-legged goblin? Are there no limits to the heresies in this place?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_02": "A skeleton with three legs? Mutation is rife in this town.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_03": "Sigmar! Do my eyes deceive me? Or is that a three-legged skeleton?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_04": "The skeleton appears to be that of an ordinary goblin, but for the obvious aberration.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_01": "Prepare yourselves! We are to be tested!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_here_they_come_02": "Sigmar stands with us, be not afraid.",

	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_01": "The truth is laid bare. This affliction began with the wealthy, not the poor.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_02": "The Adel Ring seethes with Nurgle’s corruption. We shall see it ended.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_03": "The corruption is spreading. It falls to us to end it swiftly.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_infestation_04": "It shivers my soul to see Sigmar’s Empire in the grip of such corruption.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_01": "Hard to believe that Bögenhafen's ills could come from a sword.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_a_02": "So it is a runesword draws the Dark Gods' eyes?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_b_01": "The Blightreaper is well known in... select circles. I thought it a myth.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_b_02": "Who can say what blasphemous power the Blightreaper holds?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_c_01": "Father Kraussman is an old friend. He'll help us if he can.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_intro_c_02": "Father Kraussman is a stalwart soul, and a true servant of Sigmar. We can count on his aid.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_01": "Why do you tarry! Press on! Press on!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_02": "Is there a reason for this laggardliness?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_03": "Can we go no faster? The sooner we are rid of this sword, the better.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_keep_moving_04": "Faster! Faster! We can sleep at the keep!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_01": "Unnecessary celebration not only tarnishes the spirit, it deadens the senses - why else would they not know they were invaded?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_02": "I do not blame this racket for the city's poor vigilance, but sinfulness and heresy!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_03": "This clamour deafens the citizenry! We must fight alone!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_04": "Why do you celebrate! You are invaded! Worthless wretches!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_01": "A hidden switch. Honest men do not require such secrets.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_02": "Look for a switch.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_03": "Let's find that hidden switch, shall we?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_find_04": "Seek the first switch! Move!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_01": "The next one is all we need.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_02": "Let us do this.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_03": "Nearly there!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_last_04": "One more switch should do.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_01": "Unfettered evil and corruption! Find those infernal switches!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_02": "Looks like we have another switch to activate.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_03": "Don't slouch, still more switches to do.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_objective_next_04": "More switches... Always more switches.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_01": "A miserable night. Fit for miserable deeds.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_02": "Even the skies weep for Bögenhafen.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_03": "A cold night. It is well that faith provides all the warmth I require.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_raining_04": "Yes, let the rain fall! If only it could rinse Bögenhafen of its sins.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_01": "Do my ears deceive me? Revelry as the town slides into the mire? I shall judge them all!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_02": "They celebrate, ignorant of the corruption clawing at the town. Feckless fools!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_03": "Cheers? Revelry? Are the folk of Bögenhafen blind?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_revelry_04": "This is no night for laughter, but steel.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_01": "The Sanctum Maleficarum will be well hidden. Look for a switch, or a pressure plate.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_02": "Kraussman will not have left the sanctum's entrance in clear sight. It will be hidden.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_03": "Look for a release lever. The Sanctum Maleficarum is here, somewhere.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_04": "I can smell damnation. The Sanctum Maleficarum is close, but hidden.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_01": "A seething library of heretical works. Would that there was time to destroy them.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_02": "This collection. I'd no idea Kraussman had accumulated so many damned tomes. Perhaps it is better he is dead.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_03": "This library goes beyond a priest's duty. Kraussman's curiosity was his undoing.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_04": "Hard to believe a devout priest could accumulate so much forbidden knowledge without skirting damnation.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_01": "Let us hope this approach shields us from unfavourable eyes.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_02": "Would that we had the numbers to approach directly, but we know not how deep the corruption goes.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_03": "Father Kraussman is an old friend. I pray we are in time.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_sewers_04": "When we find Father Kraussman, speak with respect, or you will answer to me.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_01": "See that smoke? Our handiwork, I deem.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_02": "So our fires yet rage in the Pit? Ha!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_03": "The Pit still blazes. And yet I imagine the sinful have learned nothing.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_smoke_pillar_04": "I weep no tears for the inhabitants of the Pit. Their laxness brought the flames, not my hand.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eight_01": "Indeed. Father Kraussman and I purged a witch's coven that laired beneath the Göttenplatz.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eight_02": "I'm sure I don't know what you mean.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_eleven_01": "Seven is the rumoured number, but the truth is unverified. The only other seen in the Empire - at least to my knowledge - was borne by the necromancer Helsnicht.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_nine_01": "Kraussman was not always a priest. He served the Order for many years.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_nine_02": "Some notion of raising folk up to be better, I understand. Too many of my kind grow soft in old age. We templars are hard, but with reason. It is a hard world.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_seven_01": "The path of the righteous is fraught with danger.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_ten_01": "We cannot fail now. Bögenhafen's deaths must have purpose.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_ten_02": "Of pragmatism, elf. There are too few righteous souls in the world. Their efforts should not be wasted.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_twelve_01": "No, master dwarf, you shall not.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_two_01": "I have heard of this Grungni Ironheart, forger of the Blightreaper. His name graces a list of pernicious foes. The Order would have... words... with him, if he lives.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_story_two_02": "Oh, there would not be many. And I doubt he would hear them uttered, once the fire took hold.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_01": "We cannot tarry! With every moment, the corruption spreads!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_02": "The hour grows late! Let us pray we are in time!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_03": "Faster, damn you! Bögenhafen depends upon us!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_taking_too_long_04": "We cannot delay! Curse your idle bones for their slowness!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_01": "We must return to the temple.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_02": "Hasten to the temple! We shall end this!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_03": "To the temple! I will not tolerate that sword’s presence here a moment longer!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_temple_04": "The temple, and with alacrity! I want that sword!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_01": "Bring that torch. We shall need it.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_02": "Faith burns brighter in torchlight than in darkness.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_03": "Put the torch to holy use. It will light our way.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_torch_04": "We must carry our own light with us.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_01": "The way is clear. Let us proceed.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_02": "Ha! The foe provides our egress!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_03": "In triumph we are shown the path. Lead on!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_city_way_out_04": "Ha! In its fury, the foe has unmade our prison!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_01": "An ambush! By the Hammer, I knew it!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_02": "So, our foes at last muster their courage?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_03": "Come, heretics! I shall redeem you all in blood!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_ambush_04": "Stand firm! We have come too far to be overcome now!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_blackfire_01": "Fort Blackfire. I harbour slim hopes that its garrison remain watchful.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_blackfire_02": "Fort Blackfire. If its garrison held proper vigil, our presence would not be necessary.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_blackfire_03": "I suspect the gaze of Fort Blackfire is fogged by drink, or undermined by heresy.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_blackfire_04": "Fort Blackfire. A bastion of order, in its day. But that, I fear, is long past.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_01": "Burn it all! Leave no scrap!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_02": "It must be purged with flame!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_03": "Let fire rage! Burn it all!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_burn_food_04": "The supplies must be burned. A drop in the ocean though they may be.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_01": "We will make our own exit. Or rather, the cannon will do so for us!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_02": "Set that cannon to use!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_03": "Walls shall not contain us - not while a cannon stands idle!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_cannon_04": "We must seek egress, and swiftly! Charge that cannon!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_01": "We are not done with Bögenhafen. Not by far.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_02": "I loathe leaving a task undone. We will be back.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_03": "We are forced to flight, but will return! The town will be purged!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_end_04": "We have learned much, but achieved little. When I return, Sigmar's wrath returns with me!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_01": "And now, we run.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_02": "Make no delay! The Pit empties on our heels!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_03": "By the Hammer! Is there an honest soul left in this wicked place?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_escape_04": "There is no end to them. Discretion serves better than valour at this time.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_01": "Here! At last. Sigmar grant that we are not too late!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_02": "This is the place! The lair of the Black Hook.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_03": "See? No mere street gang can hide from a servant of Sigmar!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_find_hideout_04": "Is this the hideout? I expected something... grander.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_01": "This goes ill. We need barricades!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_02": "That room! We can hold it against the perfidious foe!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_03": "Fortify that room! Barricades will strip them of advantage!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_04": "We must not be overrun! We shall make that chamber our bastion!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_01": "Nail the windows shut!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_02": "Seal the windows! Nothing gets in!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_03": "By the Hammer! Seal those windows!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_fortify_prep_04": "With haste! The windows must be sealed!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_01": "Sigmar! The air reeks!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_02": "That smell! 'Tis the fruit of more than ordure and slovenliness, be sure of it.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_03": "The air seethes with corruption.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_foul_air_04": "I have roamed sewers with sweeter scent.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_01": "By the Comet! The Black Hook gang's hideout must be somewhere near!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_02": "Seek out the bandits' lair! We have wasted enough time already!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_03": "Where is that cursed lair? I will find it if I have to overturn every rock and stone!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_gang_04": "The Black Hook gang's lair must be near. Find it!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_a_01": "Bögenhafen lies in the grip of daemonic contagion. There is need of righteous souls this night.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_a_02": "The Dark Gods reach out for Bögenhafen. We shall see that they are thwarted.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_b_01": "If Lohner is to be believed - and I grudgingly accept that he is - the Black Hook gang are at the heart of it.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_b_02": "Lohner's spies point to the Black Hook gang as facilitators in this heretical transaction.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_c_01": "We will know for certain once Sigmar guides us to their hideout.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_intro_c_02": "Sigmar will surely guide us to their hideout, and the truth soon after.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_01": "These provisions were stolen. From the Steinhäger family.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_02": "The Steinhäger crest? So, these provisions came from the Adel Ring.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_03": "This corruption goes deeper than I believed. See the Steinhäger crest? A wealthy family from the southern town.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noble_food_04": "That crest... So, the Black Hook stole these provisions?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_01": "We have made more subtle escapes. Move swiftly - the foe will be coming.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_02": "Damnation! We could have not announced our survival more plainly were we a marching band!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_03": "They'll be coming for us now. Move with purpose.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_noisy_exit_04": "Perhaps quieter methods would have served us better. No matter. On!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_01": "See? Wealthy Bögenhafen sleeps. Does it dream of righteousness, or perfidy?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_02": "Bögenhafen is a town divided by wealth. But united in greed.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_03": "Few nobles of the southern town would risk these streets come nightfall.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_river_04": "The town has peaceful aspect, but corruption blossoms within. Vigilance has failed this day.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_01": "I will have answers! By Sigmar, I shall! Seek them out!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_02": "To die in such numbers... They must be hiding something!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_03": "There are answers in this place, depend upon it!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_search_04": "We are close to the truth. I feel it in my bones. Search everywhere!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_01": "A burrow of iniquity, if ever I saw one. We will find answers here.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_02": "A vile warren it may be, but home to righteous folk as well as those in need of judgement.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_03": "There is godliness in poverty, if the spirit does not fall into temptation.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_slum_04": "Heresy runs rampant within this slum. I smell it on the air.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_01": "Such filth! Are these folk men, or rutting beasts?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_02": "Gah! The stench alone would drive men to madness!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_03": "Blessed Sigmar! There can be no excuse for such debasement!",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_squalor_04": "Clean air does not have a texture. And as for the smell...",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_01": "Stolen, every crate. Depend upon it.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_02": "So they are thieves and scoundrels all. But these are sins of the flesh. What of the spirit?",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_03": "A hoard of stolen wares. It surprises me not.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_stolen_goods_04": "So the Black Hook has been busy, if not honest in its labours.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_four_01": "Bögenhafen has a poor reputation. I have always believed it peasant jealousy, until now.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_nine_01": "It pains me that scum such as the Black Hook make profit from thievery and brigandage.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_nine_02": "Such is not our calling. Our skills would be wasted on mundane matters.",
	"pwh_level_bogenhafen_slum_story_ten_01": "Flames do lend themselves to purification, it is true.",

	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_state_03": "No sign of bodies, save for those we leave behind. How long has this village stood empty?",
	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_state_04": "A filthy village, and long empty.",
	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_01": "See how the northlanders cling to dry land even while squatting in a marsh?",

	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_story_eleven_02": "Yes, and not only does it house the accursed Champion, It's also the closest to Helmgart. If we are to meet with success, we must thin that town's defenders.",

	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_story_one_02": "I'd expect you to say as much. You weren't at Streissen. One lost soul slaughtered a road warden patrol.",

	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_story_three_01": "It is plain that the Rotbloods feel some kinship with the swamp.",
	"pwh_level_chaos_war_camp_story_three_02": "Tis more than that. I suspect it lies at the root of their heresy.",

	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_03": "Let us hope that tree, at least, has firm roots. 'Tis vast enough to crack the ground we stand upon.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_big_tree_04": "A fine specimen this tree. Think of the gun carriages and limbers we could fashion from its flesh.",

	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_02": "The... device... has been knocked out of alignment. The wild magic is payment for the elves' hubris.",

	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_03": "We must find the cursed control source. Perhaps those crystals?",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_seeing_puzzle_crystals_04": "Perhaps the crystals hold sway over the device? Would that we had other options.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_01": "Had we any doubts concerning natural phenomena, we should entertain them no more.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_shattered_temple_02": "Magic has torn the temple asunder!",

	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_02": "See? The colours of Clan Fester, and well-established. Shall we never be free of them?",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_03": "A Skaven way-post. This will not be the last of the ratmen.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_skaven_banners_04": "The Skaven have come this far. But did they reach the temple itself?",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_story_nine_01": "Only that they are degenerates, who bicker amongst themselves instead of opposing the true foe.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_story_nine_02": "Indeed. Would that Sigmar could return and show them the error of their ways.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_story_one_01": "So this is was once a stronghold of your people, elf?",

	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_story_ten_02": "A way will present itself. Sigmar favours those who trust to his guidance.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_01": "At last, it is done. Let us be gone from this place.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_02": "The balance is restored. Perhaps the elves of old did know their purpose.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_03": "The wild magic fades, and our task is complete.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_task_complete_04": "Praise Sigmar! We have triumphed over this wretched contraption!",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_untouched_01": "Hard to believe that such a place could go unnoticed by the Empire's scholars.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_untouched_02": "Was this valley forgotten, I wonder, or has it ever been concealed from prying eyes?",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_untouched_03": "No signs of settlement. Perhaps we are the first righteous souls to tread these glades.",
	"pwh_level_elven_ruins_untouched_04": "These trees would make for a valuable commodity, and yet no woodsman plies his trade. Strange.",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_cart_01": "Someone move that cursed cart - it's blocking our path.",

	"pwh_level_farmlands_deserted_03": "Slaughtered, or fled into the fields. Only empty buildings remain.",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_deserted_04": "Not even a single survivor...",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_end_level_01": "The captives are freed, and our work done.",

	"pwh_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_02": "Over there! Knopfelspiel's farm!",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_investigate_farm_03": "We should search the farm. Perhaps some of Sigmar's faithful yet survive.",

	"pwh_level_farmlands_last_farm_02": "Two farms beyond our aid. But what of the third? Do the captives yet live?",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_last_farm_03": "If Sigmar wills it, we will reach Morgensloft in time.",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_last_farm_04": "To have Northlanders loose within the Reikland... Such is unthinkable!",
	"pwh_level_farmlands_locked_gate_01": "The gate is locked. We must find the key.",

	"pwh_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_03": "Sigmar walks with us, and guides us to the soft white underbelly of the camp.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_spotting_docks_04": "There! The docks hold the entrance Lohner recommended.",

	"pwh_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_02": "The gate fell silent, as expected, We have a gatekeeper to find and a Keystaff to claim. Move.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_03": "Gate is down, like Lohner said. Now we need the gatekeeper and his Keystaff.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_start_up_gate_04": "We have much to do.. Should Olesya be correct, we cannot re-activate the gate without the Gatekeeper's Keystaff.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_four_01": "Sigmar will present an opportunity.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_four_02": "Fear not, Sergeant. We will find a way. Righteousness is on our side.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_seven_01": "I have been naive. The scale of the northlander threat is vaster than I could ever have guessed.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_seven_02": "We will. But what happens when the next attack comes, and the burden rests on lesser shoulders?",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_seven_03": "True enough. There is... wisdom in what you say.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_three_01": "It has been a long road, but I could not have hoped for a more stalwart companion.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_three_02": "Yes?",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_twelve_01": "We have come far. This time, we shall see the ratmen vanquished.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_story_twelve_02": "Ah, but Sigmar stands with us, and I have a shrewish elf upon whom I can depend.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_01": "Once was bad enough, but twice?! Sigmar protect me!",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_through_the_gate_02": "Sigmar! Protect your fool of a servant!",

	"pwh_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_02": "The town takes a vengeance of its own. Find the portal, and our shift is ended.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_03": "Splendiferous. The gate's remnants are buried and all we need now, is the portal.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_tunnel_collapses_04": "Look for the portal, while I relish the thought of all pact-sworn crushed in the collapse.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vacated_area_01": "I do not trust this calm. But... while the seer is away, the righteous will play.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vacated_area_02": "Listen! Quite different from the usual clamour of the ratmen, I'd say. Rasknitt's absence adds to the calm.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vacated_area_03": "Should that pestiferous Rasknitt have been here, one can safely assume we'd have faced a proper welcome by now.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vacated_area_04": "See? No Rasknitt means we're already within striking distance of the gate.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vast_camp_01": "The northlanders are a plague. If the skittergate remains open, they will spread without ceasing.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vast_camp_02": "These tents represent but a fraction of the northlands' might.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vast_camp_03": "There is no shortage of brutes in the northlands. This is but a tithe of their might.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vast_camp_04": "An army musters for invasion. We shall ensure it never reaches the Reikland.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vista_01": "It would serve us well to skirt that disturbingly massive camp. Find the route Lohner spoke of.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vista_02": "The main camp is beyond even a muster of Imperial regiments. Seek Olesya's route.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vista_03": "A frontal assault is a fool's path. Follow the route Lohner spoke of.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_vista_04": "Would that we had brought a grand army to drive those heretics into the sea! Instead, we must skulk about and follow the path Lohner mentioned.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_01": "Norsca... you frigid realm of heinous heresy. We're coming for you.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_02": "Norsca. Where the ice hides nothing but heresy and the snow is a smothering carpet of corruption.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_03": "I had hoped never to tread this land. You will soon learn why, unless the rat-gate robbed you of what little sense you had.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_welcome_to_norsca_04": "Behold Norsca - the frozen hell. One visit is one too many.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_01": "And now the warpstone outpaces us! Follow!",

	"pwh_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_04": "A mechanical wonder, harnessed to our cause. Do not let it get too far ahead!",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_winch_01": "Set the mechanism running. It will convey the warpstone to the skittergate.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_winch_02": "The Skaven devise will do our work for us. Throw the switch!",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_winch_03": "A winch-way back to the skittergate? Our good fortune is the Skaven's loss.",
	"pwh_level_skittergate_winch_04": "It is fitting that Skaven artifice now works against them. Set the device running!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_at_last_end_01": "We shall depart. But more battles await.",

	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_full_01": "That will serve. Now, to speed the cart on its way.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_full_02": "That is sufficient. Now, let the manor burn!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_full_03": "That should suffice. Send the cart into the manor!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_full_04": "If Sigmar wills it, the manor will fall! Push the cart!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_idea_01": "A cart... it begs to be filled with black powder!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_idea_02": "The cart may yet be our salvation. Let it carry the Black Powder!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_idea_03": "Let that cart serve as our vessel of retribution. Fill it with black powder!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_idea_04": "Time to burn the heretic's ill-gotten gains. Feed the cart with black powder!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_torch_01": "A torch! My good eye for a burning brand!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_cart_torch_02": "We need but bring flame. Seek one out!",

	"pwh_level_ussingen_cellar_04": "If we cannot go over, a path beneath shall serve! Down the cellar!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_devastation_01": "See? This is why we can never falter, and never let down our guard.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_devastation_02": "When next you question my methods, remember these sights, these sounds, these... smells.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_devastation_03": "Let these blood-drenched ashes remind you of our purpose!",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_devastation_04": "You think this desolation slakes the northlanders' thirst? They won't be satisfied 'til the Empire is drained dry.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_doomed_town_01": "Ussingen's fate is sealed. Whatever happens this day, the town is done.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_doomed_town_02": "Ussingen is now but a name on a map. A curiosity for the ages to come.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_doomed_town_03": "Hundreds slain, or taken captive. And this is only the beginning if we fail.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_doomed_town_04": "Such destruction. At least the Skaven left Ubersreik standing.",
	"pwh_level_ussingen_escape_01": "We should depart. A large northlander force will soon arrive.",

	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_six_01": "I ... believe I know a little of how you feel, elf.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_six_02": "There are times when I'm at a loss for what to say to you.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_ten_01": "I'm afraid I don't follow, Master Dwarf.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_ten_02": "This is not magic. This is a holy manifestation of Sigmar's wrath.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_thirteen_01": "I should have embraced this change long ago, Goreksson. Perhaps my alliance with you was a sign.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_thirteen_02": "Thin-beard? Thin-beard?!",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_three_01": "You speak of holy fury for which I am but a conduit. ",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_three_02": "It ... has a certain pleasing warmth, I must confess. ",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twelve_01": "It is not magic!",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twelve_02": "The might of Sigmar requires no vessel save a faithful soul.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyeight_01": "I suspect it has much to do with the Sons of Gilles worshipping a heathen sorceress as a deity.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyeight_02": "I ... do not believe this conversation will prove fruitful.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfive_01": "There remains time to repent thy fallen ways, Fuegonasus. Embrace Sigmar, and he shall embrace you in turn.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfive_02": "You've been talking to Goreksson, haven't you?",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfour_01": "We are allies, not friends. And we do not 'chat'. He makes his will known to me through less mundane means.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyfour_02": "Signs. Portents. The flicker of a fire. The fall of a star. The murmuration of birds.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentynine_01": "In Sigmar's sight!",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyone_01": "Insufferable? I was never insufferable. Merely outspoken.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyone_02": "I ... defer to your judgement. After all, I am sure you have much to teach me on the topic of being insufferable.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyseven_01": "You mistake Sigmar as one whose day is done, Goreksson. I merely accept this his true hour is yet to come.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentyseven_02": "I shall have no need. His return will be a clarion heard in all lands.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentysix_01": "I think the time has come to renounce your foreign sorceress and re-enter Sigmar's flock, Kruber.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentysix_02": "Indeed. Should the End Times be upon us, would you not rather be counted among those of true faith?",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentysix_03": "Alas, Kruber. I had hoped you might see reason.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentythree_01": "You make it sound like he is close kin to the gods he worships!",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentythree_02": "Have a care not to draw me into your heresies.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentythree_03": "Cease your treacherous words! We have labours to perform!",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twentytwo_01": "Does my obvious contentment discomfort you so much?",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twenty_01": "The hour of his manifestation draws ever nigh.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_twenty_02": "Faith, Kruber. You must have faith.",
	"pwh_wp_bless_conversation_two_01": "Most kind, I'm sure. Perhaps one day you will understand that all others are but empty reflections of his glory.",

	"pwh_wp_castle_briefing_01": "Aha. It is not the spectre of Constant Drachenfels who haunts this castle, but a Rotblood who seeks to usurp legends for his own purposes. I find myself greatly cheered by the prospect. After all, what is a Witch Hunter without witches to hunt?",
	"pwh_wp_castle_briefing_02": "A Rotblood has claimed Castle Drachenfels for his own, and I fear there is nothing else for it but to carve him to pieces in retribution for his black deeds. I jest, of course ... a grisly death was always to have been his fate. He has no one to blame for that but himself.",
	"pwh_wp_crater_loading_screen_01": "Warpstone hath rained down upon the world. It must be recovered  - or destroyed - before the ratmen are able to retrieve it for themselves. This will be no easy mission, but I deem we are apt to the task. At least, if the others cooperate with my instructions ...",
	"pwh_wp_crater_loading_screen_02": "A meteor split the skies this past night, and I fear it brings yet more warpstone into the world. Should the ratmen get their claws upon it, they will surely wreak great mischief before they're done. So we shall see that they do not, and enjoy ourselves greatly in the deed.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_bell_01": "The ratmen have raised a bell on Helmgart's wall. It is uncertain at this time if the artefact holds any great power, but Lohner and I are in agreement that we should not take the risk! We will have to bring it down. With all haste.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_bell_02": "If I am to understand Lohner correctly, either the ratmen have raised a bell on Helmgart's walls, or the town has been overrun by pumpkins! I confess I wasn't listening to the detail. I've found that it's often better not to. Still ... bell or pumpkins, I'm sure we will prevail.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_catacombs_01": "There is sorcery at work in the Shallyan Hospice, some malefic practice that I am sworn to root out and destroy. Ah, but it is almost like old times, when I had the support of my order ... and not a ragged band of misfits and ne'er do wells. Still, I shall persevere. Sigmar is testing me.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_catacombs_02": "The Shallyan Hospice has gone strangely silent, and rumours abound of vile magic at work beneath its hallowed walls. Such indignities shall not be borne. While the Shallyans are entirely too ... pacifist ... to be truly holy, they are nonetheless dedicated servants of righteousness. They shall be avenged!",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_cemetary_01": "The ratmen are brewing their vile concoctions in Morr's Field. I shudder to think at the ingredients they employ in their labours, though in any case the response would be the same: immediate and thorough extermination! I shall treasure the coming moments. Simple pleasures should always be indulged.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_cemetary_02": "Poison abounds in the Garden of Morr - a place that should bask only in tranquility and mindfulness. Doubtless this is ratman work, and while we shall only know for certain once the investigation is underway, my nose is twitching.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01": "It seems we have drawn the notice of the northlander chief. Good. While an array of thankless victories against nameless opponents does honour to Sigmar, the ire of one's titled enemies ranks among the sweetest of achievements. Second only to their necessary and welcome demise.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_02": "Our adversary in the northlander ranks has a name. Bödvarr Ribspreader. It is certainly ... colourful. But then, what does a name matter to a heretic bound for an unmarked grave in the Reikland mud? For that is where I intend to leave him.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_crawl_01": "Lohner is insisting that we take advantage of the recent lull and occupy ourselves with some 'quality bonding time'. The others, naturally, intend to drink  themselves into a stupor. But I intend to stay stone cold sober throughout. Someone must set an example.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_crawl_02": "Helmgart is ... quiet ... for the moment, and Lohner has suggested I spend the time carousing with my ... well, I suppose 'companions' is as good a word as any. Liquour is a mocker of wit, and the others have so few wits to begin with. I suppose I should accompany them. In a purely supervisory capacity.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_01": "It appears that the Bögenhafen plague is the consequence of my old ... acquaintance ... Father Kraussman having uncovered a cursed Chaos rune sword. Will the man never learn? No matter. Wiser hands than his will bring the matter to an end. Namely, mine.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_bogenhafen_02": "The situation in Bögenhafen is worse than we believed. The plague is no natural event, but caused by the presence of a Chaos runesword. My old ... ally ... Father Kraussman has this Blightreaper under lock and key, but I would feel safer were it in more capable hands.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_pit_01": "There is plague in Bögenhafen. Of course, there often is - most likely due to the inbred inhabitants worshipping the false god Bögenauer. Still, I suppose it costs us nothing to be certain darker forces are not at work. It has been too long since my last visit.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_dlc_pit_02": "Bögenhafen is assailed by plague. Lohner believes the Pactsworn are responsible, and this may indeed be true. I can feel my nose twitching, as it ever does when matters are amiss. An investigation is called for ... I will have the truth of this matter!",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_elven_ruins_01": "Hah! The Bridge of Shadows readily betrays its unsanctioned origins by growing ever more unreliable. I lend no credence to the notion that the problem is external, and connected to a cluster of elven ruins. But I have been outvoted. Again.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_elven_ruins_02": "This 'Bridge of Shadows' we employ is increasingly unreliable. Lohner insists the source lies in the old elven ruins a few leagues from here. Naturally, the true cause of woe is that we rely on untrustworthy magic! But I suppose it can't hurt to investigate the ruins ...",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_farmland_01": "The north empties of bloodthirsty heretics, and they waste their might on defenceless farmers. It was ever thus. The faithless lack understanding of true strength, but I shall teach them. Oh yes, I shall. Gladly.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_farmland_02": "The Pactsworn are nothing but cowards and blackguards! Why else would they waste their hel-spawned might on defenceless farmers? Fuegonasus insists we intervene and - though it troubles me greatly that this is so - I find myself in complete agreement.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_forest_ambush_01": "There are rumours of the ratmen building war engines beyond the walls. If uncontested, this will surely end badly for Helmgart, so an excursion into the forest seems called for. Perhaps the elf will actually prove useful here.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_forest_ambush_02": "The ratmen are building their damnable war engines out in the forest. This cannot be tolerated! But we must tread carefully. The forest holds many dangers, verminous or otherwise. Many a righteous man has lost his way in all that cursed greenery.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_fort_01": "Fort Brachsenbrücke is beset, and we are charged with rescuing its defenders from a most undesirable fate. Such heroics sit ill with me, I must confess, but if my humble deeds are required to restore the wavering faith of my countrymen, then I shall bear the plaudits gladly.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_fort_02": "Fort Brachsenbrücke's defenders have been lax, and call for aid. While it does no good to cosset the idle, nor can we afford Brachsenbrücke's fall, so I have magnanimously agreed to lead a relief effort to its walls. Sigmar grant that we arrive in time.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_ground_zero_01": "Lohner has received warning of a Rotblood sorcerer plying heretical mischief down in Helmgart's depths. Well! It has been some time since I was permitted to ... chastise ... a witch. Let the fellow quail to know Victor Saltzpyre hunts him now!",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_ground_zero_02": "A Rotblood sorcerer is plying his foul trade down in Helmgart's ruins. The precise details of his scheme escape me, and in truth they matter not. He is a heretic, an invader and a northlander. For those crimes alone, I would gladly see him burn.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_helmgart_military_01": "Lohner's accomplice - that disrespectful Kislevite - has departed to spy on the ratmen. To aid her mission, we are to perform one of our own. By waking the bells at the Temple of Sigmar, we shall bring half the city's pactsworn down on us. Let them come.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_helmgart_military_02": "We are called upon to create a distraction by ringing the bells at the Temple of Sigmar. This is indeed a glorious and holy mission, for such sweet chimes will surely revive the fighting spirit of embattled Helmgart. Yes! I have a good feeling about this day. A change of fortunes is on the wind.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_magnus_tower_01": "Disaster! Ubersreik is besieged by ratmen! They do exist, though the occasion of undeniable proof could be happier. The alarm must be raised if the city is to be saved ... but these companions? Kruber will serve well enough, but the witch? The dwarf? The ... elf? Trying times lie ahead, I deem.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_magnus_tower_02": "Ubersreik is assailed! By ratmen! And the only companions I have to hand are a band of misfits only a fool would trust. Still, it is the burden of the faithful to forge on through less than ideal circumstances. The Horn of Magnus must be blown, and I shall see it done.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_mines_01": "Trolls cannot be counted among Sigmar's beloved creatures, but the specimens being bred in the mines are fouler even than the norm! Some heretical scheme of the Rotbloods, so Lohner insists. I confess, I needed little convincing to put these 'experiments' to an end ... ",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_mines_02": "There are no limits to the northlanders' heresy! Even now, they are breeding an uglier, fouler strain of troll in the depths of a nearby mine. I will not allow such heresy to continue unabated! The mine must be purged, with fire and steel!",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_nurgle_01": "I have heard the name Ghûlmagak mentioned in certain ... unholy texts. The Rotbloods must not be permitted to uncover even a portion of his might. They must be stopped; their bodies - and their cursed prize - returned to the mire forthwith!",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_nurgle_02": "The Rotbloods have discovered some wretched, heretical artefact from ancient days. It is buried in the heart of a swamp, and I dread the consquences if they are permitted to claim their prize. This ... is a task for the righteous.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_01": "Karak Gnol lies in ratman hands. Freeing it is, I fear, beyond our meagre numbers, but we can at least chastise the warlord who commands the nest. His broken corpse is certain to provoke a fresh struggle for supremacy, distracting the ratmen from our labours. At least for a time.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_skaven_stronghold_02": "The dwarfen stronghold of Karak Gnol lies in the festering grip of a ratman warlord, whom Lohner has marked for death. Old alliances aside, the warlord's fall is sure to bring about schism in the enemy ranks. We can exploit that ...",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_skittergate_01": "Lohner believes that the ratman Skittergate is no longer guarded with unceasing vigilance. Hah! It is often the way that the faithless bring about their own destruction through laxity. So it shall be here, for our victory begins with the Skittergate's destruction.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_skittergate_02": "The ratmen have constructed a magical gateway in the bowels of Helmgart. It is from this portal that their faithless ranks receive endless reinforcement. But no longer. The hour has come in which it shall be destroyed. By my hand!",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_ussingen_01": "Ussingen's baron's manor has been put to work as a provisions storehouse for the northlanders. We shall burn it all. For is it not said that a starving army is one already half-defeated? I confess ... I am looking forward to this little excursion.",
	"pwh_wp_loading_screen_ussingen_02": "The heretical northlanders are using the town of Ussingen as a stockpile, from which they provision their campaigns. This, naturally, we shall not allow. It will all have to be burned. Let the northlanders eat the ashes, if they can stomach them.",
	"pwh_wp_portals_briefing_01": "Castle Drachenfels. I have no desire to walk beneath its shadow a second time, but the Pactsworn have left me little choice. In recent days, there have been many abductions from the nearby villages, and someone must fight for those people.",
	"pwh_wp_portals_briefing_02": "The Pactsworn have been abducting villagers in the shadow of Castle Drachenfels. A true servant of Sigmar knows no fear, but he should perhaps be wary - especially in such a place. But I have pledged my life to confronting evils. I will not turn back now.",
	"pwh_wv_afternoon_rain_01": "Must it always rain?",
	"pwh_wv_afternoon_rain_02": "Sigmar sends the rain to test us.",
