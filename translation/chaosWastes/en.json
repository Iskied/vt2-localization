	"pbw_bw_backstory_seven_03": "I actually liked it there. So much more honest, in a strange way. Only...",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_seven_04": "...I might have burned down Miragliano's Old Quarter as collection on a debt. I'm not welcome there any longer.",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_six_01": "Kerillian, I heard you, but I still can't let the thought go. To test myself against an elven mage!",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_six_03": "But think of the rush. The excitement. Ah, it doesn't matter. You'll never understand.",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_six_05": "Let him come! I'll give him a scar or two to remember me by!",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_three_01": "What will it take for you to trust me, Saltzpyre?",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_three_02": "And I've not spent enough blood to earn it?",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_three_03": "Yearn for?",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_two_01": "Spent some time in Tilea, when I was younger. Now there's a place where corruption's an art form.",
	"pbw_bw_backstory_two_02": "Here? The meanest burgomeister in the Reikland could learn volumes from any Tilean nobleman. And the women! Poisoners all!",
	"pbw_bw_future_eight_03": "Gorman, perhaps. And we all know what happened to him, don't we?",

	"pbw_bw_future_four_01": "Whatever for? We're two halves of the same coin, it and I.",
	"pbw_bw_future_four_02": "And according to you, we're all doomed anyway, so what does it matter?",
	"pbw_bw_future_one_01": "What if I've held back my potential, all these years?",
	"pbw_bw_future_one_02": "I'm neither the witch Saltzpyre fears, nor the disciplined wizard my tutors hoped to shape.",
	"pbw_bw_future_one_03": "I used to think so, but if I cannot be one, I must be the other. That's what I was taught.",
	"pbw_bw_future_three_01": "I've never seen a dwarf hold from within, but I think I'd like to.",
	"pbw_bw_future_three_02": "All Bright Wizards, Bardin? Or just those who hail from the desolate plains to the east?",
	"pbw_bw_future_three_03": "Met one on the Cathayan Silk Road, years back. We... disagreed.",
	"pbw_bw_future_three_04": "Oh yes.",
	"pbw_bw_future_two_01": "If you let me go, of course.",
	"pbw_bw_future_two_02": "On occasion but the college holds nothing for me. No Bright Wizard of any passion is prepared to teach, and one without passion is scarcely worth heeding.",
	"pbw_de_morris_level_conversations_fortyseven_01": "I confess, Bardin, I didn't think we'd drag you out of that workshop for this.",
	"pbw_dr_backstory_three_01": "Bardin, back in Ubersreik, you never answered Kruber's question. How a whole dwarf hold can get 'lost'?",
	"pbw_dr_backstory_three_02": "...sometimes the gate guards get drunk and lose the keys.",
	"pbw_dr_backstory_three_03": "And, the rest of the time?",
	"pbw_dr_backstory_three_04": "But that was thousands of years ago!",
	"pbw_dr_future_four_01": "Getting sentimental, Bardin?",
	"pbw_dr_future_three_01": "Give it a rest, Bardin.",
	"pbw_dr_future_three_02": "It's not the song, but the... air of cheerfulness. It becomes grating after a while.",
	"pbw_es_backstory_two_01": "So if I understand correctly, the reason you let Saltzpyre hire you, was to enable your trip back home, to Ubersreik?",
	"pbw_es_backstory_two_02": "And then the Skaven happened.",
	"pbw_es_backstory_two_03": "Aye, we do our bit, don't we?",
	"pbw_es_future_one_01": "Do you never long for a quiet life, Markus. As a farmer, maybe?",
	"pbw_es_future_one_02": "Yes. And why stick to small paths? What about forming a mercenary army of your own? I can see it now: Kruber's Ironshields.",
	"pbw_es_future_one_04": "Very wise.",
	"pbw_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_killed_01": "Grimnir's quarry's slain, darlings?",

	"pbw_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_spotted_01": "Haha! Die, beast!",
	"pbw_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_spotted_02": "So Grimnir wants this dead?",
	"pbw_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_spotted_03": "That's the one! Let's make Grimnir smile!",
	"pbw_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_spotted_04": "You reckon that's Grimnir's quarry?",
	"pbw_gameplay_curse_damage_taken_01": "Ow! Ow, ow, ow!",

	"pbw_morris_arena_survive_11": "Bring it on, Pactsworn! I've a flame for each of you!",
	"pbw_morris_arena_survive_12": "We'll burn them all, darlings!",
	"pbw_morris_arena_survive_13": "Flames! Let's shown these bounders a thing or two!",
	"pbw_morris_arena_survive_14": "They'll not stop us, darlings! Not so close!",
	"pbw_morris_arena_survive_15": "Don't know about you, darlings, but I mean to win!",
	"pbw_morris_arena_survive_16": "I'm not dying here, which means this lot will have to!",
	"pbw_morris_bardin_song_sienna_13": "Where did we come from? Over the mountains. Where are we going? Over the mountains.",
	"pbw_morris_bardin_song_sienna_14": "Where is my sweetheart? Over the mountains. Where is my hearthfire? Over the mountains.",
	"pbw_morris_bardin_song_sienna_15": "Where have my kin gone? Over the mountains. Where does my king rule? Over the mountains.",
	"pbw_morris_bardin_song_sienna_16": "Where are we buried? Under the mountains. Where are we sung of? Under the mountains.",
	"pbw_morris_bay_cursed_shore_01": "It's like the sea swallowed them up ...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_cursed_shore_02": "I've heard of this place - a Cursed Shore where the seas swallow ships whole ...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_cursed_shore_03": "I think this might be the Cursed Shore ... But then, everything around here is cursed.",
	"pbw_morris_bay_cursed_shore_04": "Let's be very careful about taking ship from here, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_bay_ice_cave_01": "Chilly in here, isn't it darlings?",
	"pbw_morris_bay_ice_cave_02": "There's more than ice buried here ...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_ice_cave_03": "This isn't a natural chill, darlings ... There's something else here ...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_ice_cave_04": "I sense something, hidden beneath the ice. Let's not disturb it.",
	"pbw_morris_bay_lookout_01": "Watchtowers! ",
	"pbw_morris_bay_lookout_02": "Watchtowers! Not that they don't already know we're here ...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_lookout_03": "Watchtowers! I hope there's not a larger camp around the corner!",
	"pbw_morris_bay_lookout_04": "Must be a well-travelled route to have watchtowers.",
	"pbw_morris_bay_stranded_ships_01": "Well, you don't see that every day...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_stranded_ships_02": "Interesting approach to harbourage, eh darlings?",
	"pbw_morris_bay_stranded_ships_03": "Looks like I could teach them a thing or two about sailing...",
	"pbw_morris_bay_stranded_ships_04": "How do you suppose those ships ended up there?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_altar_01": "Well, we've come this far. What's the harm?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_altar_02": "Well darlings, time for the moment of truth?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_altar_03": "All right Myrmidia, let's see if you're listening ...",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_altar_04": "Let's hope it was worth it.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_fall_01": "Take my advice, darlings: don't look down.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_fall_02": "It's a good use of space ... but it could use a balustrade.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_fall_03": "It's a long way down, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_fall_04": "Watch your footing, darlings. ",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_gateway_01": "Welcoming, isn't it?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_gateway_02": "A skull always makes me feel welcome ...",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_gateway_03": "This, darlings, is the door to the Citadel!",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_gateway_04": "The Citadel beckons, darlings!",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_offering_01": "I wouldn't touch the gold, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_offering_02": "Cursed gold, I suspect, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_offering_03": "Imagine carting a load of treasure all this way ...",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_offering_04": "Can the gods be bribed? It doesn't seem likely.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_second_vista_01": "Say what you want, but this place has style!",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_second_vista_02": "I do like it here, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_second_vista_03": "This place gives one a new perspective, don't you think?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_second_vista_04": "It's nice to see an architect using their imagination ... ",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_third_vista_01": "It is nice in here, but it could use a few fires ... Just to warm it up.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_third_vista_02": "Do you suppose any of this is real?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_third_vista_03": "Nice as it is, I wouldn't say no to some more floors.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_third_vista_04": "I hear there's a room in the Grey College just like this ... only murkier.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_throne_01": "Nice throne, but it's not my colour.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_throne_02": "I wonder who that throne belonged to? Or the other way around.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_throne_03": "A wizard's throne? A priest's? Or a fool's?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_throne_04": "Nice throne darlings, don't you agree? It'd look lovely back in the keep.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_vista_01": "Roomy, isn't it?",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_vista_02": "I like what they've done with place.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_vista_03": "Well ... This is definitely unusual, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_citadel_vista_04": "I like it! Do you think we can move in?",
	"pbw_morris_crag_city_01": "Now this is more like it! I can almost see the city as it was.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_city_02": "It's like ... a bloodstain more than a ruin. An echo of what was.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_city_03": "What stones remain are steeped in magic. Oh, to have seen it in full glory!",
	"pbw_morris_crag_city_04": "This was a beautiful place once, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_fumes_01": "Crystalised sorcery on the air, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_fumes_02": "The air's thick with foul magic ... don't breathe too deep.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_fumes_03": "A sorcerous fume ... Try not to breathe too much, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_fumes_04": "Hold your breath where you can ... I don't like this mist.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_hollowed_01": "Even the rocks are decaying ... Not a good sign.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_hollowed_02": "The bedrock is crumbling. Too much magic run wild, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_hollowed_03": "Everything's falling into decay - even the mountain itself.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_hollowed_04": "The whole crag's on the point of total collapse. Let's be somewhere else when it goes.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_ritual_01": "Ah ... I thought the scent of magic was growing stronger.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_ritual_02": "Some leftover ritual, perhaps?",
	"pbw_morris_crag_ritual_03": "Well, that's not a very pleasant brew, is it?",
	"pbw_morris_crag_ritual_04": "Sorcerous vortex in our path, darlings!",
	"pbw_morris_crag_towers_01": "We're standing in the remnant of something much grander, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_towers_02": "I know Olesya said this was once a city, but I expected a little more to be left.",
	"pbw_morris_crag_towers_03": "Everything's so worn away - magic carries a price ...",
	"pbw_morris_crag_towers_04": "Sorcery clings to these stones ... Do you not feel it?",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_01": "I sense sorcery ahead, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_02": "Sorcery ahead ... We should be careful.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_03": "There's magic on the wind. Dark magic.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_04": "Yes ... Someone's playing with dark magic up ahead.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_05": "I'm sensing dark magic ahead, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_06": "There's a ritual ahead. I feel it in my water.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_07": "Darlings? Keep your eyes open. I've a bad feeling.",
	"pbw_morris_foreboding_08": "Dark magic ... Yes, I'm sure of it. Be careful.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_beacons_01": "Always nice to see flames.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_beacons_02": "Ah, what lovely flames ... ",
	"pbw_morris_forest_beacons_03": "Careful darlings, those fires might be part of a ritual.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_beacons_04": "Ritual fires? Could be. I'm sure we'll be fine.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_chaos_star_01": "Well, we're certainly seeing unusual sights on this little jaunt ...",
	"pbw_morris_forest_chaos_star_02": "Oh, now they're just showing off! I could put sculptures in the sky if I wanted!",
	"pbw_morris_forest_chaos_star_03": "Ah! The eight-pointed star of indecision!",
	"pbw_morris_forest_chaos_star_04": "Aha! The eight-pointed star of prevarication!",
	"pbw_morris_forest_mine_01": "Underground, again?",
	"pbw_morris_forest_mine_02": "Looks deserted. I mean, apart from the ratties and rotbloods, obviously.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_mine_03": "Into the darkness? Fire light my way!",
	"pbw_morris_forest_mine_04": "I've never liked mines. They sound possessive.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_river_01": "Maybe the river knows the way out?",
	"pbw_morris_forest_river_02": "Never trust a river north of the Sea of Claws, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_river_03": "Do we follow the river, or whimsy? I've always liked whimsy.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_river_04": "Hello, river. How are you today?",
	"pbw_morris_forest_skulls_01": "Ah ... The bigger the skull, the bigger the trouble.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_skulls_02": "There's nothing natural about those skulls, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_forest_skulls_03": "Are the skulls placed in warning, or in artistry, I wonder?",
	"pbw_morris_forest_skulls_04": "Look at those skulls! Can we take one back to Taal's Horn Keep?",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_cliff_town_01": "I think it's fair to say we've caused quite a stir, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_cliff_town_02": "Another northlander town where we're not welcome ...",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_cliff_town_03": "That's another town we've not had time to burn ... it's very distressing.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_cliff_town_04": "We make friends everywhere we go, darlings. Have you noticed that?",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_effigy_01": "Doesn't he look happy? No?",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_effigy_02": "It doesn't look like a fertility idol ... though you never know.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_effigy_03": "Look at that fine fellow, darlings. I declare it looks just like Victor!",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_effigy_04": "What a fine fellow they've built. Almost certainly comelier than the daemon it's meant to be!",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_river_course_01": "I've a feeling our fates are bound to this river, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_river_course_02": "The river's headed where we're going, or vice versa.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_river_course_03": "And ... here's the river again.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_river_course_04": "It's the river again. Do you think it's following us? Can't be too careful around here.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_settlement_01": "Swamps? Ugh.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_settlement_02": "What did I say last time, darlings? No more swamps!",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_settlement_03": "I was very clear on this: no more swamps, marshes or mires!",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_settlement_04": "A horrible smell and soggy feet! Wonderful!",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_skull_01": "Well, that's a grisly little memorial.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_skull_02": "Another ritual site, but I think it's unfinished ... fortunately.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_skull_03": "Look at the skull on that ... I wonder who it's supposed to be?",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_skull_04": "See that skull? Might be an offering, but it's probably a ritual site.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_sky_01": "Ah ... I rather prefer my skies free of giant, pointy rocks.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_sky_02": "Don't look up, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_sky_03": "If you're feeling nervous, darlings, I'd not look to the skies.",
	"pbw_morris_gorge_sky_04": "It's the chains I don't understand. Are those rocks really going to float away?",
	"pbw_morris_hub_conversation_one_a_01": "Well, these little expeditions of ours have been interesting, haven't they, darlings?",
	"pbw_morris_hub_conversation_one_a_02": "I never thought rambling around the Chaos Wastes could be such fun!",
	"pbw_morris_hub_conversation_one_b_01": "It's freeing, don't you think? I feel like a great weight's been lifted from my shoulders!",
	"pbw_morris_hub_conversation_one_b_02": "It's delightful, darling. I always like to travel to new places and immolate new people.",
	"pbw_morris_hub_conversation_one_c_01": "I'm sure it'll only get better. You'll see.",
	"pbw_morris_hub_conversation_one_c_02": "Well, make the most of it while you can. Though we could be doing this a while.",
	"pbw_morris_hub_interact_myrmidia_01": "Myrmidia is the goddess of war and of the blazing sun. She favours strategy over savagery, and has ever sided with those in greatest need of divine intervention.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_01": "Rambler always said there was magic to spare in the Chaos Wastes. It's true ... but it's not right somehow.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_02": "There's always ... something ... at the edges of my thoughts. Do you hear it?",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_03": "Do we really think this pilgrimage will change anything darlings? I suppose it can't hurt.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_04": "If I've use for a god at all - if, mind you - I suppose I admire the more direct ones. Like Myrmidia.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_05": "We had a priest of Myrmidia pass through the village when I was a girl. Well, more like a knight, really.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_06": "Myrmidia's the patron of war, artistry and justice ... or so I was told. War should have art and order, don't you think?",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_07": "This is such a cruel place. I don't pity the northlanders, but I suppose I understand them better.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_08": "Don't you find this unsettling, darlings? None of it's real ... and yet it's all too real.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_09": "Sofia always said I'd set a god aflame if I ever met one. Might be we'll find out ...",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_10": "If the Chaos Gods have their way, the whole world will be like this ... One mad, bloodsoaked arena.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_11": "You know, darlings, a piece of me feels at home up here. That should scare me, shouldn't it?",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_12": "Have you noticed, darlings, how every new challenge brings us closer to the brink ... a few years ago, we'd never had dared attempt this.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_13": "That daemon in Castle Drachenfels - the one we don't talk about - do you think it knew we'd be coming here?",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_14": "This place does bring back memories ... only they're not ones I remember.",
	"pbw_morris_introspection_15": "Darlings ... What if fire alone isn't enough for what's coming? What if it requires something ... more?",
	"pbw_morris_intro_line_12": "Yes. What could possibly go wrong?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_eight_01": "I still don't understand the elven pantheon, Kerillian.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_eight_02": "And you worship the Cadai or do you worship the Cytherai?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_four_01": "I confess, Bardin, I don't know much about the dwarf Ancestor Gods beyond Grimnir, Grungni and Valaya.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_four_02": "Protector of the Dead? We could use a Protector of the Living right about now.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_khorne_twentyfour_01": "You've got it easy, Bardin. Khorne hates wizards, so guess who's first on his list?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_mordrek_ten_01": "So who was this Count Mordrek?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_nineteen_01": "Do you suppose there are any other Chaos Gods?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_nineteen_02": "Oh, I know. You should have heard some of the arguments at the Bright College.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_nineteen_03": "Luthor Flamestrike always contended there were at least fifteen - except for when he thought there were only two - but then he never was much good at counting.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_nine_01": "So why didn't Sigmar drive the forces of Chaos back, if he were so powerful?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_nine_02": "So if Chaos is destroyed, there's no need for Sigmar any longer? Interesting.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_one_01": "You know, Saltzpyre, I never expected you to suggest something like this pilgrimage.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_one_02": "It's not exactly in line with Sigmarite teachings, is it?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_seventeen_01": "They're welcome to it, Bardin. ",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_sixteen_01": "Rotbloods and ratties. It's like they knew we were coming.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_sixteen_02": "Lucky us. Unlucky them.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_six_01": "Do the elves have many gods, Kerillian?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_six_02": "Dark? That's unusual. Most folk seek deities who embody their virtues?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_thirtytwo_01": "You need to let that go, Markus.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_tower_twelve_01": "You don't know the half of it, Bardin. Supposedly he went in the Realm of Chaos and back. His Liber Malefic is --",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_twentytwo_01": "Oh dear ... He's going to go full flagellant again.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_twenty_01": "Like there's a change coming? I feel it too.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_twenty_02": "And will you?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_tzeentch_twentyseven_01": "I quite agree, Bardin. Iridescent cinders just don't look the same, do they?",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_tzeentch_twentysix_01": "Met a Tzeenchian sorcerer once. He was all 'I know your destiny' this and 'Tzeentch is architect of your fate' that.",
	"pbw_morris_level_conversations_tzeentch_twentysix_02": "Couldn't tell you. His speech lost clarity once I set him on fire. Went up like a candle. It was lovely to watch.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_one_01": "Four Chaos Gods, but which is the worst, darlings?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_one_02": "So, there are four Chaos Gods - if we're taking the 'official' line. One has to be the worst. Who is it?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_all_branches_reply_01": "Not the answer I'd have given, but I see your point, darling.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_all_branches_reply_02": "Interesting. You're wrong of course, darling.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_branch_five_reply_01": "Raising the tone of debate, Markus? I knew we could rely on you.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_branch_three_reply_01": "His followers are no good for conversation, either. All that growling and snarling.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_two_branch_two_01": "Tzeentch, darlings. He's called 'The Great Deceiver' for a reason.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_two_branch_two_02": "Tzeentch, no question. Honestly, who uses pink fire when there's perfectly good orange flame close to hand?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_beta_one_01": "Plenty of mortals have become gods. What would you choose to be?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_beta_one_02": "Many that are divine were once mortal. What you would be a god of, darling?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_beta_three_01": "Lucky break for the world that you're not, then.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_beta_three_02": "Best you stay mortal I think, darling.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_beta_two_01": "You have to ask? Fire, darling! A beautiful, brilliant goddess of living flame.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_beta_two_02": "Sienna the Incandescent. Oh, there'd be a reckoning, I can tell you!",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_one_01": "Have you never wondered what made this place as it is, darlings?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_one_02": "Do you know what created the Chaos Wastes, darlings?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_all_branches_reply_01": "Sound unlikely, but doesn't everything?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_all_branches_reply_02": "There might be something in that ...",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_branch_five_reply_01": "Frogs, Markus? I've warned you about listening to Olesya's stories, haven't I? She's not well.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_branch_four_reply_01": "I'd not heard that, Kerillian. You must tell me about it sometime.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_two_branch_two_01": "Magic, darling. Lots and lots of magic. ",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_delta_two_branch_two_02": "What else? Magic gone out of control.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_one_01": "Plenty of gods in the world - too many - so why choose as you have?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_one_02": "What made you choose your patron above all others, darling?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_three_01": "The important thing is that you're happy, darling.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_three_02": "Well, each to their own.",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_two_01": "Myrmidia? You do know that she's a sun goddess? And that the sun is on fire?",
	"pbw_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_two_02": "Myrmidia strives for artistry in war. Also, she doesn't like bullies ... like these northlanders.",
	"pbw_morris_met_god_conversation_01": "Would you believe, Myrmidia sounded like me? Maybe gods always appear to their worshippers thus?",
	"pbw_morris_met_god_conversation_02": "I could have been speaking to my twin ... but Sofia's long dead, so it couldn't have been her ...",
	"pbw_morris_mines_closed_gate_01": "Someone's been feeding a daemon in here...",
	"pbw_morris_mines_closed_gate_02": "Blood and bones and ... Oh, we're next.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_closed_gate_03": "They've been sacrificing to something, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_closed_gate_04": "A pit of sacrifice? Maybe this isn't a mine after all ... It's a larder!",
	"pbw_morris_mines_entrance_01": "Been busy little bees, haven't they?",
	"pbw_morris_mines_entrance_02": "Into the pit? I knew it was going to be this sort of day ... ",
	"pbw_morris_mines_entrance_03": "Into the pit? What if I want fresh air instead? What of that?",
	"pbw_morris_mines_entrance_04": "Another day, another lengthy trudge beneath the rocks.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_passageways_01": "It's a bit tangled down here, darlings.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_passageways_02": "We'll have to follow our judgement through this maze. Lucky us.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_passageways_03": "There has to be a way out somewhere.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_passageways_04": "Roaming beneath the Chaos Wastes ... What would Sofia say to that?",
	"pbw_morris_mines_poison_01": "What's that smell? It's not me!",
	"pbw_morris_mines_poison_02": "Oh brilliant. It's not just a cave, it's a smelly one too.",
	"pbw_morris_mines_poison_03": "Let's hope that isn't poisonous gas I smell ...",
	"pbw_morris_mines_poison_04": "Something stinks down here ...",
	"pbw_morris_mines_settlement_01": "The pit daemon had a lot of worshippers, didn't he?",

	"pdr_morris_introspection_03": "Gods of war and slaughter are all very well, but I prefer a deity that brings folk together.",

	"pdr_morris_introspection_11": "Every dawi knows you can't defeat the Kazaki Gromthi and their followers, but it doesn't mean you can't fight!",
	"pdr_morris_introspection_12": "Not sure I believe in this Citadel of Eternity, but we'll see what we find.",
	"pdr_morris_introspection_13": "I hear if you travel too far north, you end up in the realm of the Kazaki Gromthi, so let's not do that!",
	"pdr_morris_introspection_14": "Think on everything you've seen up here dawri, and tell me you don't think magic should be controlled by runes!",

	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_five_02": "Aye, very like that, but don't you dare tell anyone I said so.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_four_01": "Well there's Morgrim, Patron of Engineers. Smednir, God of Smelting. Thungni, the First Runesmith. Gazul, Protector of the Dead ...",

	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_nurgle_twentynine_02": "Hah. Doesn't seem to work out for the Rotbloods.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_seventeen_01": "Looks like the Rotbloods have claimed this section of the wastes for themselves, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_seventeen_02": "Aye. But what else will they take alongside?",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_seven_01": "Aye, Azumgi! It's why the Empire flourishes. They had the good sense to come round to the dawi way of thinking.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_seven_02": "Nonsense, Grimgi! Sigmar even had a beard! See? Proof!",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_slaanesh_thirtyone_01": "Good job none of us are the obsessive types, then.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfive_01": "Only that he was a fine lad, and absolutely not a heretic, despite his recent obsession with this Citadel of Eternity. I thought it might help.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfive_02": "Thought it'd carry more weight, coming from one of his own. ",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_three_01": "Good idea of Grimgi's, this. Can't hurt to get ask the gods for a bit of help.",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_three_02": "He's worried. Any wazzok can see that. ",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_tower_twelve_01": "Marius Holseher? What was an Imperial citizen doing up here?",
	"pdr_morris_level_conversations_tzeentch_twentyseven_01": "Never understood the point of worshipping Tzeentch. All mucking around with funny fire. Fire's fire, and that's that.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_one_01": "I've been thinking, dawri - which of these four great Kazaki Gromthi is a slayer's dream?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_one_02": "Four Chaos Gods, drengbarazi. Which do you suppose'd give a slayer the most glorious death?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_all_branches_reply_01": "Hmmm ... There might be something in that.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_all_branches_reply_02": "Suit yourself, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_branch_five_reply_01": "Aye, Nurgle's a bad one. Mind you, they all are.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_branch_one_reply_01": "You take the fun out of everything, Grimgi.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_two_branch_three_01": "They're none of them good, but Khorne's the worst. Battle without honour and oath shouldn't be encouraged.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_two_branch_three_02": "It'd be that wazzok Khorne! You fight to defend your own, not for fighting's sake.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_beta_one_01": "Maybe we'll be ancestor gods one day ... What would you be a god of?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_beta_one_02": "So ... If you were an ancestor god, what'd you be?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_beta_three_01": "A weighty loss for the world, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_beta_three_02": "The world'll cope without your wisdom, I'm sure.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_beta_two_01": "I'm not sure, drengbarazi. Most of the good stuff's covered. Gobbo-slaying, maybe?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_beta_two_02": "Gobbo-slaying, perhaps? Or maybe just general thumping of thieving wazzoks? That works too.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_one_01": "Never did find out what created these Chaos Wastes ...",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_one_02": "Did they ever agree what created these Chaos Wastes?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_all_branches_reply_01": "Oh aye, that sounds about right.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_all_branches_reply_02": "Doesn't sound far wrong, if you ask me.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_branch_four_reply_01": "Aye. Elgi gods. Can't go trusting elgi gods and expect it to work out ...",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_branch_one_reply_01": "Mind you, sins are all relative, aren't they, Grimgi? I hope ...",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_two_branch_three_01": "I heard it was the elgi. Sooner or later, they ruin everything.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_delta_two_branch_three_02": "Oh aye, the elgi were to blame. Wherever there's trouble, there's an elf.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_one_01": "So, that patron god of yours ... Why that one? Why not someone else?",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_one_02": "You've got your patron god ... I'm curious as to why you chose like that.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_three_01": "Odd choice, but it's not like you're dawi. Can't expect sense.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_three_02": "Doesn't matter. Valaya'll see you're not short of ale ... so long as you hold true.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_two_01": "Valaya's a sturdy lass and handy with an ale. And she knows that home and kin are the only things that matter.",
	"pdr_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_two_02": "Valaya fights for hearth and home, and so do I. It's not complicated, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_met_god_conversation_01": "Valaya sounded like my Grelda. Still my hearth and home, even now.",
	"pdr_morris_met_god_conversation_02": "Valaya? It was like being taken to task by my Grelda. Happier times. I wish they were back.",

	"pdr_morris_mines_passageways_03": "Chasing a seam's one thing, but you do it orderly, or not at all!",
	"pdr_morris_mines_passageways_04": "Not a single boki worth his ore among them ...",
	"pdr_morris_mines_poison_01": "Doesn't smell like fire damp, but doesn't smell good ... ",

	"pdr_morris_mordrek_breach_03": "It's like I always say: if you can't go over a wall, go under!",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_breach_04": "Looks like the raki tunnelled through. Should've seen that coming.",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_end_01": "No much of the place left, is there?",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_end_02": "Vast fortress, umgak keep. Just like a kazaki'dum.",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_end_03": "Someone's been skimping on buttresses ... ",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_end_04": "The fortress is hollow. Much like the kazaki'dum themselves, eh?",

	"pdr_morris_mordrek_siege_camp_02": "Looks like the pactsworn have been taking lumps out of each other.",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_siege_camp_03": "Looks like a siege. Then again, these northlanders are always squabbling.",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_siege_camp_04": "Seems we've stumbled across a siege, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_ward_01": "Well, here we are. Can't say I'm impressed.",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_ward_02": "Well, it looks impressive enough, but will it be standing in a thousand years, eh?",
	"pdr_morris_mordrek_ward_03": "I suppose it's grand ... by manling standards.",

	"pdr_morris_ritual_start_08": "I think they're messing with Olesya's magic, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_run_complete_01": "Come to Bardin, aha!",
	"pdr_morris_run_complete_02": "Got it! So what happens now?",
	"pdr_morris_run_complete_03": "Scroll of Eternity? Doesn't look like much.",
	"pdr_morris_run_complete_04": "I have it, Drengbarazi!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_one_01": "Oi-oi! It's the Helmgart barracks. ",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_one_02": "The Helmgart barracks. Scene of one of my many victories!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_one_03": "Helmgart ... or nearly.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_one_04": "Looks like Helmgart. At least, how Helmgart looks when Catrinne's been painting it!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_three_01": "Do you remember the day I clove that raki warlord in twain?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_three_02": "Ah, Karak Gnol. We settled many grudges that day!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_three_03": "Karak Gnol ... Now that was a mighty victory!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_three_04": "Are we down in Karak Gnol?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_two_01": "Oh, it's here. I remember being very ... heroic.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_two_02": "Look familiar, dawri? Remember those farmers we saved?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_two_03": "Can't remember the name of the mill. It was one of those odd umgi ones.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_a_two_04": "This takes me back. So many kills worthy of song!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_one_01": "Looks like Ussingen, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_one_02": "Are we back in Ussingen?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_one_03": "Oh, it's that Empire town the dumi razed. What was its name?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_one_04": "Not much left of this place, is there?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_three_01": "This is where we fought that sorcerer, isn't it? Burblebobble Hatstand?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_three_02": "Didn't we fight Blunderstoat Habitat around here?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_three_03": "I remember this! Scene of my victory over Bubblesplat Habblebabble!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_three_04": "This looks familiar. Aha! Bugelblob Hagglespit's lair!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_two_01": "Oho! We're in the mines!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_two_02": "Keep your eyes open for trolls, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_two_03": "Ohhh... It's that dumi troll pit, isn't it?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_b_two_04": "The troll mines! Time for some kulgur!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_one_01": "Remember the Skittergate, dawri? Made a very satisfying kaboom!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_one_02": "Ah, the Skittergate! Another mighty victory!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_one_03": "Do you suppose we get to kill that raki seer again?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_one_04": "Remember that raki seer? Remember that pathetic little scream of his?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_three_01": "It's a like a tour of our greatest victories, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_three_02": "Ah, the Fall of Bödvarr Ribspreader! Good times, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_three_03": "Oho! It's the triumph of Bardin Goreksson over that smelly kazaki'dum!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_three_04": "Strange how we keep revisiting old triumphs, isn't it?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_two_01": "Much of Helmgart looks the same to me, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_two_02": "Can't quite tell which bit of Helmgart this is ...",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_two_03": "Helmgart ... Aye, that seems right.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_c_two_04": "Looks like Helmgart. Smells like it too ...",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_one_01": "So we get to purge Karak Gnol once again! Splendid!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_one_02": "Here we go hunting raki heads, raki head, raki heads ...",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_one_03": "Karak Gnol? Nice to be in familiar surroundings.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_one_04": "I'll never say no to fighting in a dawi hold!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_three_01": "A sewer? Oh well, underground's underground!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_three_02": "Fighting raki in a sewer? Aye, why not!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_three_03": "We'll get this place emptied out in no time!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_three_04": "Aha! Bardin Goreksson, sewer patrol-dawi, reporting for duty!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_two_01": "Remember that brawl in the Red Moon, dawri?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_two_02": "We've not had a proper fight here yet, have we?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_two_03": "Strange to see the keep like this ...",
	"pdr_morris_snare_d_two_04": "Better not tell Catrinne about this battle - Valaya alone knows what she'd paint!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_one_01": "This elgi scrapheap doesn't look any better the second time around ...",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_one_02": "The crumbling elf temple? Why are we back here?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_one_03": "Still a pile of second-grade stone, even in illusion.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_one_04": "Athel ... thingy. Elf names are a mouthful, not worth remembering.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_three_01": "Looks like a mine!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_three_02": "It's a mine ... I'm sure we've been here before.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_three_03": "This place looks familiar, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_three_04": "Have we been here before, drengbarazi?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_two_01": "Wasn't there a raki bell last time?",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_two_02": "I remember - there was a bell ...",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_two_03": "Oh ... the raki and their kruting bell. That was fun!",
	"pdr_morris_snare_e_two_04": "Bardin Goreksson and the Fall of the Raki Bell. A grand adventure, it was!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lair_01": "Someone's not very house proud.",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lair_02": "I'm amazed even this much is still standing ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lair_03": "Not very cosy, is it dawri?",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lair_04": "I like my rooms to have four walls ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_ledge_01": "Mind your step, dawri ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_ledge_02": "This is bracing ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_ledge_03": "The whole lot could give way at any moment!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_ledge_04": "Bit of a wobble there ... I'm sure it'll be fine ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_library_01": "Lot of good kindling in here.",
	"pdr_morris_tower_library_02": "Strange place to keep a library.",
	"pdr_morris_tower_library_03": "I suppose they don't have to worry too much about thieves up here ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_library_04": "Who needs this many books? No one trustworthy, that's who!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lookout_01": "We'll make it ... as long as the tower doesn't collapse under us!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lookout_02": "Isn't far now, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lookout_03": "One last effort ... Let's hope the tower holds!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_lookout_04": "Is the tower shaking, or is it me?",
	"pdr_morris_tower_stairs_01": "These aren't proper stairs!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_stairs_02": "It's a rare wazzok who doesn't know how to build stairs!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_stairs_03": "What umgak stairs!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_stairs_04": "Up the umgak stairs ... Ba-rum ta-tum ta-tum ...",
	"pdr_morris_tower_towervista_01": "What a mess! Not a scrap of good stone in sight!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_towervista_02": "What wazzok built that thing?",
	"pdr_morris_tower_towervista_03": "Look at the state of the ruin!",
	"pdr_morris_tower_towervista_04": "We're not going up there are we dawri?",
	"pdr_morris_town_arena_01": "Oi-oi! It's an arena!",
	"pdr_morris_town_arena_02": "An arena! Bring 'em on!",
	"pdr_morris_town_arena_03": "An arena? Come on then! This dawi stands ready!",
	"pdr_morris_town_arena_04": "You want to see a fight, dumi? Well step right up!",
	"pdr_morris_town_behind_01": "That's those kruti shown a thing or two ...",
	"pdr_morris_town_behind_02": "Those dumi will remember this day, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_town_behind_03": "Hah! That's shown the wazzoks!",
	"pdr_morris_town_behind_04": "Settled a grudge or two back there, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_town_harbour_01": "Pitiful harbour. It's a wonder they ever manage to set sail!",
	"pdr_morris_town_harbour_02": "Death sails south from here, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_town_harbour_03": "Lots of blood on these shores, drengbarazi.",
	"pdr_morris_town_harbour_04": "Dumi reckon themselves heroes for slaughtering the defenceless. Kruting akuzzi!",
	"pdr_morris_town_settlement_01": "Looks like a raider's camp to me, dawri!",
	"pdr_morris_town_settlement_02": "Oh ho! Time to reave the reavers!",
	"pdr_morris_town_settlement_03": "It's a raider's camp! Let's give the wazzoks a bit of payback!",
	"pdr_morris_town_settlement_04": "A raider camp? Ready to settle some grudges, dawri?",
	"pdr_morris_town_shipwreck_01": "Look at that umgak ship. Metal! Always metal!",
	"pdr_morris_town_shipwreck_02": "Dumi ships have a black reputation, but not if there's a dawi Nautilus prowling.",
	"pdr_morris_town_shipwreck_03": "A raiding ship. You'll note they never go near Barak Varr!",
	"pdr_morris_town_shipwreck_04": "Doesn't matter how loud dumi crews ship if their ships are torpedoed before they reach shore!",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_face_01": "Dawri ... the mountain has a face.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_face_02": "Why does the mountain have a face?",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_face_03": "Boga? That's an ugly gob up there.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_face_04": "Look at that kruting face!",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_fortress_01": "Never thought I'd be worried about getting closer to a mountain ...",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_fortress_02": "I really don't like the look of this mountain, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_fortress_03": "I'm not saying I'm scared of the mountain. Never that. But it's not right.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_fortress_04": "I'm not even sure that is a mountain, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_glacier_01": "Always liked glaciers. They're old. Traditional. Hard as nails.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_glacier_02": "Never quarrel with a glacier, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_glacier_03": "Glaciers are like dawi. You get out of the way, or get crushed!",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_glacier_04": "Ah, a glacier. I almost feel at home!",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_ice_fire_01": "No winners when ice meets fire, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_ice_fire_02": "The ice is winning for now, but the fire always returns.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_ice_fire_03": "Ice is determined, I'll give it that.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_ice_fire_04": "Ice above, fire below and us in between.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_lava_01": "There's power in lava, if you can harness it right.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_lava_02": "Looks like a young volcano - full of vim and vigour.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_lava_03": "Fire mountains make the best holds ... once they're tamed.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_lava_04": "Can't beat a volcano for a source of good stone, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_outpost_01": "Looks like this place is settled ... or was, at least.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_outpost_02": "Signs of an old fortress maybe?",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_outpost_03": "Where there's a watchtower, there's a fortress. Mark my words.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_outpost_04": "There's a watchtower. Let's hope there's not much else.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_settlement_01": "See? I said there'd be fortress ... if not much of one.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_settlement_02": "This place has seen better days, dawri.",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_settlement_03": "Umgak! Everywhere we go, umgak!",
	"pdr_morris_volcano_settlement_04": "I smell kazaki'dum cultists! Come out, kruti!",
	"pdr_we_backstory_five_01": "Don't hear you speak much of home, wutelgi, or kin.",
	"pdr_we_backstory_five_02": "Easy, Azumgi. No sense being heartless, even against... her.",
	"pdr_we_backstory_five_03": "Really? Over what?",
	"pdr_we_backstory_three_01": "That bottle of brandy probably didn't help.",
	"pdr_we_backstory_three_02": "Don't tell me the keep's haunted.",
	"pdr_we_backstory_three_03": "Kerillian? Never heard her sing. She saves her voice for insults.",
	"pdr_we_backstory_three_04": "I believe you manling. Just as I believe it'd probably be unwise to confront her about it.",
	"pdr_we_future_three_01": "So, Grimgi tells me you've been dreaming of the future?",
	"pdr_we_future_three_02": "You have fears? You?",
	"pdr_we_future_three_03": "I don't know what you're suggesting, wutelgi.",
	"pdr_wh_backstory_five_01": "And what would you know of good steel, Grimgi?",
	"pdr_wh_backstory_one_01": "Kruber's always talking about his past, Grimgi, but I know nothing about your family.",
	"pdr_wh_backstory_one_02": "Sounds like a hard life.",
	"pdr_wh_backstory_one_03": "Aye, trust's a trickier burden than most, I'll give you that.",
	"pdr_wh_future_four_01": "We'll soon have these Northlanders dealt with, Grimgi, you'll see.",
	"pdr_wh_future_four_02": "Then why so dour? Think of the songs they'll sing. #A fivesome bold, they...#",
	"pdr_wh_future_four_03": "We'll handle that business too, Grimgi. And besides, there's always more coming.",
	"pes_additional_backstory_conversation_one_01": "Me? Coached a bit of Middenball, back in the day. Fine boys, every last one.",
	"pes_additional_backstory_conversation_one_02": "Couldn't face it after the accident. They said it was mechanical failure. But I reckon some enterprising sort cut the cables on the lift. It's a long way down from the Fauschlag. Whole team, gone in a flash, and me asked some very pointed questions. It's a cut-throat game, and it don't just stay on the field, if you take my meaning?",
	"pes_arena_citadel_continue_01": "Move on up! ",
	"pes_arena_citadel_continue_02": "We can get moving!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_continue_03": "Shift yourselves!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_continue_04": "Come on! What's the delay!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_final_01": "Here we are! One last fight!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_final_02": "King Taal! This is for you!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_final_03": "Break some heads, we're almost there!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_final_04": "Dig deep and let's ... Get. This. Done!",
	"pes_arena_citadel_start_01": "Well, looks like we're here.",
	"pes_arena_citadel_start_02": "Just think, we're nearly there.",
	"pes_arena_citadel_start_03": "Mother Kruber's favourite son in the lap of the gods. Literally.",
	"pes_arena_citadel_start_04": "King Taal, I'm coming to you!",
	"pes_arena_ice_continue_01": "Gate's open! Let's not dawdle!",
	"pes_arena_ice_continue_02": "Looks like the gate's open.",
	"pes_arena_ice_continue_03": "Gate's clear. Time to move!",
	"pes_arena_ice_continue_04": "Move your feet! The gate's open!",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_cross_01": "Looks like it's stuck. Can we get across?",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_cross_02": "Stuck like a pig in a gate. We can cross though, yeah?",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_cross_03": "That's not moving further. But I bet we can cross now.",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_cross_04": "I guess we're using the boat as a bridge, then.",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_response_01": "Backs to the water it is!",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_response_02": "Weapons up! Meet 'em with steel!",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_response_03": "They'll wish they never came to this shoreline!",
	"pes_bay_ship_challenge_response_04": "Let's hope Olesya's got a good trick up her sleeve!",
	"pes_bw_backstory_seven_03": "So, about Tilea. From what you told me, it's no wonder you left.",
	"pes_bw_backstory_seven_04": "Only what?",
	"pes_bw_backstory_seven_05": "Can't think why...",
	"pes_bw_backstory_two_01": "Have you travelled far beyond the Empire?",
	"pes_bw_backstory_two_02": "Not like here, then.",
	"pes_bw_backstory_two_033": "Sounds like the good old Empire ain't that bad after all. Taal knows I've had my doubts.",
	"pes_bw_future_five_01": "I think she might have lost it. I've been fearing this...",
	"pes_bw_future_five_02": "You've gone a tiny bit psychotic, love.",
	"pes_bw_future_one_02": "How so, Sienna?",
	"pes_bw_future_one_03": "But that's good... Isn't it?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fiftyone_01": "You sure you can't gimmick up a dwarfen contraption to save us some of this traipsing about?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fiftyone_02": "The sights? I've already seen my fill of crazed northlanders, thank you very much.",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fifty_01": "Why didn't you build one then?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fifty_02": "Yeah? Well, that's still better than all this walking, ain't it?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortyfour_01": "You reckon there's any hope for the future, Bardin?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortyfour_02": "Funny. I think Saltzpyre says much the same, though the context's a little different.",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortysix_01": "Ain't that a bit dangerous? Locals ain't exactly friendly.",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortysix_02": "Cousin Okri's not exactly a good shot, then?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortythree_01": "Shouldn't you been invoking Morgrim, now you're an engineer?",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortythree_02": "So are ours, by and large. Probably why they squabble, now I think about it.",
	"pes_de_morris_level_conversations_fortytwo_01": "What? Don't reckon the gods will help?",
	"pes_dr_backstory_five_01": "Got to admit, you use that shield well, Bardin. Not what I expect in a ranger.",
	"pes_dr_backstory_five_02": "I know, but this is more than that. You and it belong together.",
	"pes_dr_backstory_six_01": "Bardin, about that shield-work of yours.",
	"pes_dr_backstory_six_02": "Well, I remember back at Axe Bite Pass, old Kazador was there, and so were his Ironbreakers...",
	"pes_dr_backstory_six_03": "I knew it! Why'd you give it up?",
	"pes_dr_backstory_two_01": "Still no luck finding that Karak Zoom of yours?",
	"pes_dr_backstory_two_02": "And when you've found it? What then?",
	"pes_dr_future_four_02": "He is getting sentimental. And it'll get worse as I pour ale down his throat, but then he'll bounce right back.",
	"pes_dr_future_one_01": "Don't know. One moment they were there, the next...",
	"pes_dr_future_one_02": "Easy now, Goreksson. I was only...",
	"pes_es_backstory_four_01": "They're avenged. That'll have to do. No happy endings in these times.",
	"pes_es_backstory_four_02": "Is there no cheer in dwarf holds? You always seem glad enough.",
	"pes_es_backstory_huntsman_five_02": "There was an insult there, but it was sort of... embedded.",
	"pes_es_backstory_huntsman_five_04": "Oh, no, no. Not this again. We have explained to you exactly what a Witch Hunter of the Order is. You didn't listen?",
	"pes_es_backstory_one_01": "Don't miss the marching. Or the officers. This isn't so bad.",
	"pes_es_backstory_one_02": "I've known worse than him. Might've eased one or two along their way, if you follow.",
	"pes_es_backstory_three_01": "If a soothsayer had predicted all this, I'd 'ave laughed in his face.",
	"pes_es_backstory_three_02": "Oh, not that. Knew that was me path since I killed that tuskgor on the old farmstead. It's the company.",
	"pes_es_backstory_three_03": "Listen, no one in my village had ever seen an elf, and it'd been years since a dwarf passed through.",
	"pes_es_backstory_two_01": "That was the plan. Escorting a dangerous witch like you.",
	"pes_es_backstory_two_02": "Aye. And all the flinging cross the Grey Mountains. Stromdorf. And don't forget that business on the Reik. We were winning until we weren't.",
	"pes_es_backstory_two_03": "But we're here, fighting, and hopefully causing daily fits of rage for Rasknitt and his cronies.",
	"pes_es_future_five_01": "The problem with the Empire ain't with the soldiers. It's with those who give the orders.",
	"pes_es_future_five_02": "Yeah? Well maybe that ain't good enough.",
	"pes_es_future_five_03": "I think I'm prepared to give it a try.",
	"pes_es_future_four_01": "Umm.. No I don't. And this ain't exactly the first time you've asked about me and him.",
	"pes_es_future_four_02": "So!? The fact is, it appears you care about absolutely nothing in the human world, except my relationship with Saltzpyre!",
	"pes_es_future_one_01": "Me? No. Too quiet after all I've seen. From now on, it's the mercenary road for me.",
	"pes_es_future_one_02": "Reading my mind again, Sienna? I mean, absolutely! I like the name. And I'd want a wizard close to hand, of course.",
	"pes_es_future_three_01": "As you know, I'm putting together a mercenary concern...",
	"pes_es_future_three_02": "Thought you'd approve. Reckon I could find any interested dwarfs?",
	"pes_es_future_three_03": "You reckon it will?",
	"pes_es_future_two_01": "Me? Become a templar? A witch hunter?",
	"pes_es_future_two_02": "That's very good of you, sir. But I don't want to make plans just yet.",
	"pes_es_future_two_03": "Yeah, that's what I was thinking.",
	"pes_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_killed_01": "Worthy? I think so.",
	"pes_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_killed_02": "I've always been worthy... of something, at least.",
	"pes_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_killed_03": "So Grimnir approves now, is that it?",
	"pes_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_killed_04": "Oi, Grimnir! Smacked the beastie down, like you asked!",
	"pes_gameplay_blessing_grimnir_spotted_01": "That'll be a challenge!",

	"pes_morris_gorge_cliff_town_03": "What comes first, do you think? The idol or the town?",
	"pes_morris_gorge_cliff_town_04": "Wouldn't catch me living on a cliff face. I can fall off anything.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_effigy_01": "Not sure I'd worship that.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_effigy_02": "So, which of the Chaos Gods looks like that, do you suppose?",
	"pes_morris_gorge_effigy_03": "Laugh at the idol all you like, but I've seen 'em come to life.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_effigy_04": "Nice idol ... if you like that sort of thing.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_river_course_01": "We're back at the river. Let's hope that's good news.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_river_course_02": "Here we are again ... back at the river.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_river_course_03": "You ever think the river knows something we don't?",
	"pes_morris_gorge_river_course_04": "I think this is the same river from before.",
	"pes_morris_gorge_settlement_01": "Homely little place, ain't it?",
	"pes_morris_gorge_settlement_02": "Never understood the attraction of living in a swamp.",

	"pes_morris_gorge_sky_03": "I like the sun. Don't mind the odd cloud. But those?",
	"pes_morris_gorge_sky_04": "The sky's gone mad. So that's nice, then.",
	"pes_morris_hub_conversation_one_a_01": "What do you reckon to our little adventures, then?",
	"pes_morris_hub_conversation_one_a_02": "How are you finding these here Chaos Wastes?",
	"pes_morris_hub_conversation_one_b_01": "Can't complain. After all, who'd listen if I did? But it's a real eye-opener.",
	"pes_morris_hub_conversation_one_b_02": "Not something I saw myself doing, I must admit. But I'm glad I did.",
	"pes_morris_hub_conversation_one_c_01": "I just wish there was more to drink, is all.",
	"pes_morris_hub_conversation_one_c_02": "Yeah. Pity about the northlanders, but I suppose they come with the territory.",
	"pes_morris_hub_interact_taal_01": "Taal, the Lords of Beasts is a patron of hunters. He is an intemperate being, swift to anger and unswerving in pursuit, but he's favoured by those who live in the wilds.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_01": "You're a long way from home, Markus. Better watch your step.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_02": "There's a proper kind of madness up here. Worse, it's tempting.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_03": "I've had too many mates drift this way, looking for 'freedom'.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_04": "I hate this place. Big old wasteland vomiting out death onto civilised realms.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_05": "Look at it all. This ain't a battle we can win. We can only hold it at bay.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_06": "Special kind of mad up here, ain't it? Good job we're all sane, eh?",
	"pes_morris_introspection_07": "I don't much like the thought of a Chaos God giving me a gander.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_08": "Taal watch over me. I mean properly. Ain't no game being up here.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_09": "Nothing's right up here, is it? Even the air's strange.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_10": "You take all this in and it's easy to see why Praag fell.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_11": "Good of Olesya to get us around that big golden wall. Wish I were on the other side of it.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_12": "So ... if there's a big golden wall between the Empire and Kislev, why'd we think it was a good idea to sneak through?",
	"pes_morris_introspection_13": "I hope this is worth it. No one comes up here and gets back home the same as they left.",
	"pes_morris_introspection_14": "I hear the Chaos Wastes change you, one way or the other. Let's hope it's for the better, eh?",
	"pes_morris_introspection_15": "So far, so good. It'll stay that way so long as no one starts singing.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_eighteen_01": "I heard there's more than four Chaos Gods.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_eighteen_02": "No one you'd know, so there's no need to get that look in your eye.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_fifteen_01": "Yeah. This just gets better and better, don't it.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_five_01": "I hear a lot about a fellow called Grombrindal. Is he an Ancestor God?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_five_02": "A bit like Cousin Okri?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_fourteen_01": "If these wastes are full of northlanders, why do we keep seeing only Rotbloods?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_fourteen_02": "Or else the others are all elsewhere, hammering against that golden wall of Balthasar Gelts.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_khorne_twentyfive_01": "Khaine? Who's that then?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_khorne_twentyfive_02": "I'll pass, if it's all the same to you.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_mordrek_ten_01": "That doesn't sound so bad.",

	"pes_morris_level_conversations_nurgle_twentynine_01": "Those who don't want to catch them, I guess.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_nurgle_twentynine_02": "Depends on how you look at it ... They're still alive, ain't they?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_seven_01": "I suppose when you look at it right, Sigmar's a sort of Ancestor God, ain't he?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_slaanesh_thirty_01": "Funny, really. Set against gods of Blood, Magic and Plague, Slaanesh seems the least of the lot.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_slaanesh_thirty_02": "That's not a figure of speech, is it?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_slaanesh_thirty_03": "Tell you what, forget I spoke.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfive_01": "Oi, Bardin! What did you put that letter to that Witch Hunter General? Saltzpyre's had a reply.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfive_02": "Yeah. that's not gonna get misinterpreted ... And signed in my name, Lohner tells me?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfive_03": "Brilliant. Just bloody brilliant. Saltzpyre's gonna kill me.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfour_01": "Oh no. Look, if it's about that letter, I had nothing to do with-",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtyfour_02": "Really couldn't say. You'd have to ask Bardin.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtythree_01": "I never asked him to ... Oh Taal, what's he done now?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtytwo_01": "All this talk about being the God of That Which You Most Desire ... It's got me thinking.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtytwo_02": "Karl Franz, the God of Hats, anyone? Specifically, other people's hats.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_thirtytwo_03": "Easy for you to say. Wasn't your hat.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_tower_thirteen_01": "So, this Marius Holseher ... He's a heretic?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_tower_thirteen_02": "Sure, whatever you say. But you do know that we've got loads of his paintings in the keep?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_twentyone_01": "You seem distracted, Kerillian.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_twentyone_02": "Yeah? What does that mean?",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_two_01": "Saw you planning this expedition back at the keep. Never thought you'd find common ground with Olesya.",
	"pes_morris_level_conversations_two_02": "Say no more. They'll not get a whiff of it from me.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_one_01": "Who do you reckon's the worst of the Dark Gods?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_one_02": "All the Chaos Gods are vile, of course, but which do you think's the worst?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_all_branches_reply_01": "Funny. I never looked at it like that.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_all_branches_reply_02": "Something to think on there, I reckon.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_branch_four_reply_01": "Yeah. Funny how rich folk always end up worshipping Slaanesh, ain't it?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_three_branch_two_reply_01": "Yeah. That sounds a bit suspect, if you ask me.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_two_branch_five_01": "Nurgle - Which you'd understand if you'd ever had explosive dysentery ... For instance, I mean. Not, ahem, personal experience.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_alpha_two_branch_five_02": "After everything we've been through with the Rotbloods? Gotta be Nurgle. Fat bastard that he is.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_beta_one_01": "Gods, then. Would you be one, if you could? What'd you stand for?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_beta_one_02": "Who'd be a god, eh? Would you? What would you, you know, stand for?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_beta_three_01": "Good talk. Let's do it again sometime.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_beta_three_02": "Yeah, well ... That's something to think on, and no mistake.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_beta_two_01": "Never thought much about it, if I'm honest.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_beta_two_02": "Doesn't seem my place. Besides, it sounds like a lot of work.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_one_01": "Desolate place. Why's it like this, anyway?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_one_02": "Strange place, ain't it? How did it end up this way?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_all_branches_reply_01": "Makes for a good story, certainly.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_all_branches_reply_02": "Really? Tell me more, as they say.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_branch_one_reply_01": "Nothing wrong with a nice bit of sin now and then. Lifts the spirits.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_three_branch_two_reply_01": "Yeah. Magic's always tricky. When I was a kid, I saw a mummer get eaten by his own puppets. Took the shine off that birthday, it did.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_two_branch_five_01": "Frogs. I heard it was frogs. Really big frogs.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_delta_two_branch_five_02": "Yeah, I know this one. It was all down to a plague of frogs, or something.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_one_01": "What drove you to choose that god? While we're talking.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_one_02": "Never did ask why you worship as you do, did I?",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_three_01": "Whatever drives your elbow and all that.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_three_02": "Long as it gives you purpose and gets the job done, I guess.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_two_01": "Taal's a hunter, and so am I - no matter what hat I'm wearing.",
	"pes_morris_loading_conversation_gamma_two_02": "Wasn't much food about when I was a nipper. Good to have Taal when you're starving.",
	"pes_morris_met_god_conversation_01": "Being honest, most of us needed to hear a mightier version of ourselves, so that's what we got. Don't know if that's godly, magic or what. But I guess it means we're self-centred.",
	"pes_morris_met_god_conversation_02": "Taal? He sounded a bit like me. I still think it was all a trick. Went looking for help from who we respect the most, and that's what we got.",

	"pes_morris_mountain_monolith_04": "Big old monolith, that. Or maybe it's just really close. What do you think?",
	"pes_morris_mountain_ritual_location_01": "A subtle offering, for northlanders.",
	"pes_morris_mountain_ritual_location_02": "It's a land of ritual, but so's the Empire.",
	"pes_morris_mountain_ritual_location_03": "Looks like a place of old religion ...",
	"pes_morris_mountain_ritual_location_04": "Gods hold sway over everything up here ...",
	"pes_morris_mountain_stacked_stones_01": "Interesting eye for art, these northlanders.",

	"pes_morris_ritual_start_01": "What's that ritual for? Who cares? Stop it!",
	"pes_morris_ritual_start_02": "I love breaking rituals. Makes me smile!",

	"pes_morris_ritual_start_04": "Can't pass up the opportunity to smash a ritual, can I?",
	"pes_morris_ritual_start_05": "Oh look, filthy magic. Let's put a stop to it.",
	"pes_morris_ritual_start_06": "They're up to no good. Let's have a word.",
	"pes_morris_ritual_start_07": "Looks like a ritual. Explains my bad feeling.",
	"pes_morris_ritual_start_08": "Oh ... It's a ritual. No wonder I had the heebie jeebies.",
	"pes_morris_run_complete_01": "Well, that's the scroll. Wonder if it's worthy anything?",
	"pes_morris_run_complete_02": "Got it! Guess we can go home now?",

	"pes_morris_snare_b_one_02": "No point asking how we got here, I suppose?",

	"pes_morris_snare_b_one_04": "No one razes a town like a northlander ... except a Middenlander.",
	"pes_morris_snare_b_three_01": "Oh yeah. Remember our drowning dwarf?",
	"pes_morris_snare_b_three_02": "Helmgart again? Fair enough.",
	"pes_morris_snare_b_three_03": "Helmgart. Canal District. You can tell by the smell.",
	"pes_morris_snare_b_three_04": "Bet you an ale this is Helmgart.",
	"pes_morris_snare_b_two_01": "Troll caves? Definitely troll caves.",
	"pes_morris_snare_b_two_02": "Don't know about you, but I'm thinking trolls.",

	"pes_morris_snare_c_one_01": "Oh no, not the bloody Skittergate ... Please?",
	"pes_morris_snare_c_one_02": "It's like we never left.",

	"pes_morris_snare_c_three_02": "Showed that Ribspreader fellow, didn't we?",
	"pes_morris_snare_c_three_03": "I wonder if Ribspreader's still around?",
	"pes_morris_snare_c_three_04": "Isn't this where we clobbered that warlord?",

	"pes_morris_snare_d_one_01": "Skaven nest? But which one?",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_one_02": "Definitely a ratman nest ...",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_one_03": "Is this one of those rattie strongholds?",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_one_04": "We definitely came through here ... Where are we?",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_three_01": "Sewers. Have I ever mentioned how much I hate sewers?",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_three_02": "We're beneath the Helmgart hospice, ain't we?",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_three_03": "Trudging through filth. One day's much the same as the next ...",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_three_04": "I was born to do more than stumble through the sewers ...",
	"pes_morris_snare_d_two_01": "Home sweet home ...",

	"pes_morris_snare_e_one_02": "Is this that elven temple? Athel ... Athel Yenlowy? Yenlala?",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_one_03": "Oh ... It's the temple. The one with all the wild magic.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_one_04": "Reckon there'll be wild magic this time?",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_three_01": "A big cave. A very big cave.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_three_02": "Looks like a big cave. Beyond that, who knows?",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_three_03": "Dark, bleak and foreboding. Good times.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_three_04": "Where are we? There'd better be a way out.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_two_01": "Don't tell Lohner we were here. He'll start talking about pumpkins again.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_two_02": "It's the posh bit of Helmgart. Well, as posh as it gets.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_two_03": "Helmgart. Almost sure of it.",
	"pes_morris_snare_e_two_04": "Almost certainly Helmgart ... I think.",

	"pwe_morris_snare_a_three_02": "If I never see another dwarf hold again, it'll be too soon.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_a_three_03": "I swear this place still stinks of rotting dwarf!",
	"pwe_morris_snare_a_three_04": "A dwarf hold should never be a welcome sight.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_a_two_01": "I hope we're not saving mayflies again. It hardly seems worth the bother.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_a_two_02": "Lileath, let this not be another rescue mission.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_a_two_03": "It's the Ussingen farm, isn't it?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_a_two_04": "I remember this farm. We saved folk, and never a word of thanks.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_one_01": "The town of Ussingen, and in a sorry state.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_one_02": "This wretched enchantment is sifting our memories, mayflies!",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_one_03": "I've no need to be reminded of Ussingen, thank you.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_one_04": "Ussingen was not our finest hour, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_three_01": "Didn't Bardin fall a canal in somewhere around here?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_three_02": "Isn't this where Bardin fell in the canal?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_three_03": "You remember what Bardin looked like when we fished him out of the canal?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_three_04": "Ah! The domain of Bardin the unlikely river monster, complete with a crown of weed!",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_two_01": "The troll caves. How nice.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_two_02": "I always wanted to return these caves. I surely did.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_b_two_03": "The one place I love beyond all others.",

	"pwe_morris_snare_c_one_01": "Please tell me there's no Grey Seer.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_one_02": "As long as there's no Grey Seer, I am content.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_one_03": "I've tried to forget this place. I'll try harder.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_one_04": "So long as Rasknitt's not back from the dead, we'll be fine.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_three_01": "Isn't this where we duelled that Rotblood warchief?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_three_02": "Didn't we fight a Rotblood warchief around here?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_three_03": "Mayflies ... This is where Kruber did that unspeakable thing to the Rotblood chief, isn't it?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_three_04": "We bested the Rotbloods here once. We'll do it again.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_two_01": "Helmgart again? Oh well.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_two_02": "I never cared for Helmgart, mayflies.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_two_03": "If we ever come back here again, I'll burn it down myself.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_c_two_04": "I wouldn't mind being back here, but the streets are so ... disorganised.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_one_01": "Back in the belly of the mountain, I see.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_one_02": "Is this Karak Gnol?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_one_03": "Looks like Karak Gnol, but to be honest they all look the same to me.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_one_04": "That's it! Karak Gnol - the skaven warlord's lair!",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_three_01": "This ... is beneath the Shallyan hospice, isn't it?",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_three_02": "We're beneath the Shallyan hospice, mayflies.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_three_03": "Swamps, yes. Sewers? Ugh.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_three_04": "A sewer. Fantastic.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_two_01": "You know, I had a dream just like this.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_two_02": "Aha. Welcome, my recurring dream.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_two_03": "Am I dreaming, lumberfoots? It's getting so hard to tell.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_d_two_04": "Oh. It's the old dream again. Fair enough.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_one_01": "Ah, pleasing surroundings at last.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_one_02": "Athel Yenlui ... I've missed you.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_one_03": "At last! A little elegance in our quest!",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_one_04": "Now this? This is much better!",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_three_01": "Down in the mines? Lucky us.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_three_02": "We're in the mines again, mayflies.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_three_03": "Well, there are worse places to be.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_three_04": "It could be better, but it could be much worse.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_two_01": "Is there a bell to destroy? Lohner will want to know.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_two_02": "I hope we're not to destroy another bell.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_two_03": "Helmgart? This place is a ball and chain about my ankle.",
	"pwe_morris_snare_e_two_04": "Helmgart again. We'll never leave.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lair_01": "What a mess! ",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lair_02": "Who'd live here, anyway?",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lair_03": "The owner's long gone, I imagine.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lair_04": "What kind of glaikit mayfly would choose to live here?",
	"pwe_morris_tower_ledge_01": "Don't stare so, mayflies. There's plenty of path.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_ledge_02": "What? This is wide enough for an army!",
	"pwe_morris_tower_ledge_03": "I don't know why you're staring. There's plenty of room.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_ledge_04": "Just keep your balance, and you'll be fine!",
	"pwe_morris_tower_library_01": "Only an amnesiac owns so many books!",
	"pwe_morris_tower_library_02": "Imagine having to write things down to remember them.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_library_03": "Remember, mayflies: books do not imply wisdom.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_library_04": "A library. The strangest of status symbols.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lookout_01": "Would you look at that: all this way, and nothing's collapsed.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lookout_02": "The tower's still standing? Our luck must be changing.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lookout_03": "Maybe the tower's more stable than it looks ... it'd have to be.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_lookout_04": "Well, we've not fallen into the valley, so that's good.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_stairs_01": "Interesting design to these stairs ... ",
	"pwe_morris_tower_stairs_02": "Takes a lot of effort to get stairs wrong ...",
	"pwe_morris_tower_stairs_03": "Don't worry. I'm sure the stairs will take my weight.",

	"pwe_morris_tower_towervista_01": "Now that's a crooked tower!",
	"pwe_morris_tower_towervista_02": "I'm sure that tower's totally safe.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_towervista_03": "I swear that tower's rocking back and forth.",
	"pwe_morris_tower_towervista_04": "Knowing our luck, that tower will topple into the valley as soon as we're inside!",
	"pwe_morris_town_arena_01": "An arena, is it? Come, scunners! I shall not be found wanting!",
	"pwe_morris_town_arena_02": "They want to see a fight in this arena? Very well!",
	"pwe_morris_town_arena_03": "An arena? It's never seen the likes of us, mayflies!",
	"pwe_morris_town_arena_04": "We're in an arena, mayflies! Let's show them a fight worth seeing!",
	"pwe_morris_town_behind_01": "A enjoyable diversion, but where's the path?",
	"pwe_morris_town_behind_02": "That town will not soon forget us, mayflies!",
	"pwe_morris_town_behind_03": "We're through the town ... so what's next?",
	"pwe_morris_town_behind_04": "The arena's behind us. Onwards, lumberfoots!",
	"pwe_morris_town_harbour_01": "Come the summer, this harbour will be full of slaves and screams. ",
	"pwe_morris_town_harbour_02": "These folk are jailers and pillagers. There is no fate too bleak for them.",
	"pwe_morris_town_harbour_03": "This harbour still echoes with its victims' screams.",
	"pwe_morris_town_harbour_04": "I wish the sea would swallow this whole place up.",
	"pwe_morris_town_settlement_01": "A raider's camp. Built on the bones of better men.",
	"pwe_morris_town_settlement_02": "There is no virtue in raiding for plunder alone.",
	"pwe_morris_town_settlement_03": "A raider camp. Death should always serve more than gratification.",
	"pwe_morris_town_settlement_04": "The northlands have no shortage of raiders. It's a coward's vocation.",
	"pwe_morris_town_shipwreck_01": "That ship looks fit to sink. What a pity.",
	"pwe_morris_town_shipwreck_02": "The vessel's no match for the winter storms.",
	"pwe_morris_town_shipwreck_03": "A raiding ship. These scunners praise courage but possess little of their own.",
	"pwe_morris_town_shipwreck_04": "A ship without crew. Let's hope they met an agonising end.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_face_01": "What horror lurks within the mountain?",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_face_02": "A daemon! Lileath preserve us!",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_face_03": "A daemon awaits! I should never have come here.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_face_04": "That is no chance formation, mayflies. There is evil in that mountain.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_fortress_01": "Pray Lileath we need approach the daemon no closer ...",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_fortress_02": "Is our path to lead into the daemon's maw?",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_fortress_03": "I cannot stray into the daemon's grasp, mayflies. I will not.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_fortress_04": "This is a road to damnation. It is a poor way to meet our end.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_glacier_01": "Guide us well, Father Rime, for our need is great.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_glacier_02": "Trust to the glacier, mayflies. It knows the way.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_glacier_03": "Trust to the glacier's purity, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_glacier_04": "The glacier will serve us well.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_ice_fire_01": "Glacier and worldblood. Ancient forces brought into conflict.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_ice_fire_02": "Ice and fire. It's a war beyond our influence, mayflies.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_ice_fire_03": "Ice and fire. Order and chaos. Mayflies and elves. This place has everything.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_ice_fire_04": "Ice and fire. It's a war of the natural world, what little endures.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_lava_01": "The world bleeds. Its wounds are deep.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_lava_02": "The world is torn. It may never heal. ",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_lava_03": "Can you not feel the Weave's agony? Lava is the least of it.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_lava_04": "These are wounds, angry with lava.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_outpost_01": "If there's a watchtower on the slopes, there'll be eyes further up too.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_outpost_02": "It won't just be that one watchtower, mayflies.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_outpost_03": "There's no road to guard. That watchtower serves a large settlement.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_outpost_04": "Our approach is watched, lumberfoots.",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_settlement_01": "The cultists' lair ...",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_settlement_02": "Why do the scunners bother with this place?",
	"pwe_morris_volcano_settlement_03": "What is it about this place that draws the scunners?",

	"pwe_we_backstory_five_03": "The dead. What else?",
	"pwe_we_backstory_one_01": "I have many other names, and I shan't share them.",
	"pwe_we_backstory_one_02": "A name is a personal thing. It has power. I've never understood why mayflies are so free with theirs.",
	"pwe_we_backstory_one_03": "Real enough for our current purpose.",
	"pwe_we_backstory_two_02": "I too am surprised. My standards are slipping.",
	"pwe_we_backstory_two_03": "I'm not one of your quarries, One-Eye.",

	"pwe_we_backstory_two_06": "If I catch you at it, you'll lose your other eye. Do you understand me?",
	"pwe_we_future_five_01": "I... cannot. Not until my penance is done. I must set the Weave right.",
	"pwe_we_future_five_02": "The Weave is everything. It is a balance that must be preserved.",
	"pwe_we_future_five_05": "Aye, someone did.",
	"pwe_we_future_four_01": "More than you know.",
	"pwe_we_future_four_03": "If I answer you, will you cease your glaikit yammering?",
	"pwe_we_future_four_04": "Very well. I made a mistake, and until I've made amends, I cannot go back. All right?",
	"pwe_we_future_one_01": "You'd trust my kind?",
	"pwe_we_future_one_02": "And that's why such an alliance would be fleeting. Your kind are strongest when certain. We are at our weakest.",
	"pwe_we_future_three_01": "I've dreamt of darkness. Perhaps it is the future. Perhaps it is nothing but my own fears.",
	"pwe_we_future_three_02": "Aye, never being able to return home. Surely you know the feeling?",
	"pwe_we_future_three_03": "Don't deny it. Outcasts know one another by sight. Especially those responsible for their own fate.",
	"pwe_we_future_two_01": "And am I not marching to war, Kruber?",
	"pwe_we_future_two_02": "Maybe I find you... efficient, in your own mayfly sort of way.",
	"pwe_we_future_two_03": "Ach, just forget I said anything.",
	"pwe_wh_backstory_five_01": "So persecution is a family trade?",
	"pwe_wh_backstory_five_02": "I shouldn't be surprised. Misery grows bleak blooms.",
	"pwe_wh_backstory_two_01": "Aye, what of it?",
	"pwe_wh_backstory_two_02": "Would I lie about something like that?",
	"pwe_wh_backstory_two_03": "I don't know. Sometimes dreams are dreams. Sometimes they're not. Why does it matter?",
	"pwe_wh_backstory_two_04": "Well, what kind of something?",
	"pwe_wh_future_three_01": "Not by his standards. But he has shown interest in my dreams lately.",
	"pwe_wh_future_three_02": "Said he'd seen something similar, but then clammed up like a dwarf's purse.",

	"pwh_bw_future_eight_03": "Sienna, I believe it would help your trial if you showed intent to go back to the College. Are there really none there who hold your respect?",

	"pwh_bw_future_two_01": "Once this is settled, you should consider returning to the Bright College for further tutelage.",
	"pwh_bw_future_two_02": "Of course. But let us assume I will. Have you thought of returning to Altdorf?",
	"pwh_bw_future_two_033": "I see. The armies of the Empire always need more Battle Wizards. I suggest you once again answer the call, should you be exonerated.",

	"pwh_es_backstory_three_03": "These are strange times, and the Empire is at their heart. I have no doubt we will see stranger.",
	"pwh_es_future_five_01": "Most are honest folk, fulfilling their duties as best they can.",
	"pwh_es_future_five_02": "And you think you can do better?",
	"pwh_es_future_two_01": "Tell me, Kruber. Have you considered striving for the Order?",
