Its previous owner, a fellow Ostland Swordsman, was fortunately wise enough to clearly mark the helmet with Imperial insignia to avoid being mistaken for the enemy on the battlefield. \\n\\nPirazzo's Lost Legion shot to fame as the only survivors of the Lustrian expedition funded by the merchants of Tobaro. The ill-fated expedition ran into trouble as soon as the mercenary regiments had landed on the shores of Lustria. The sailors of the ships, who were also mercenaries, weighed anchor and abandoned the soldiers, taking the pay chests of the three regiments with them. Of course, as a precaution against an opposed landing, the pay chests had been left to last! \\n\\nPirazzo was the only commander to advise against leaving the pay chests behind and the mercenaries now realized that he was by far the best leader and the other regiments mutinied. Their incompetent and unfortunate captains were cast adrift and the remaining men joined together as a single regiment under Pirazzo’s command, calling themselves the ‘Lost Legion’. \\n\\nThe Lost Legion, thirsty for the riches hidden in the jungle, embarked on a series of grand adventures and battles. First they clashed against the Skinks and Lizardmen, until a pragmatic Slann Mage priest used both magic and payment in treasure to turn the Lost Legion's pikes and crossbows towards the undead of the Vampire Coast. Victorious, Pirazzo's mercenaries assembled a fleet and crossed the ocean. They landed in Araby and then fought their way through Sartosa to finally arrive in Tilea.",

Don’t worry, she’s alright. Thing about skirts is they’re good for hiding knives, and Catrinne’s got as many knives as she has paintbrushes.\\n\\nThing is, she took something strange off one of the corpses. A trinket of dwarfen make, by the looks of things – a lodestone. Catrinne gave it to me, Olesya nicked it out of my quarters… and, well, she thinks it’s important. \\n\\nI told her that you found it, by the way.

She doesn’t know what, of course. Only that there are three dwarfen runes hidden about the place that serve as the key to its hiding place.\\n\\nNow, we can’t very well go back to Ubersreik. Even if we weren’t up to our eyes in it over here, half of the place is in ruins by now. Could be our runes have gone to wherever it is runes go when they die. But Olesya has a plan.\\n\\nI know, terrifying, right? Olesya with a plan’s a bit like one of those skaven mining machines. It’ll get you where you want to go, but one false move and you’ll not whistle a jaunty tune ever again.\\n\\nOlesya reckons she can craft an illusion of Ubersreik as it was just as things started to go south. Once you’re inside, you can have a dig around for these runes – maybe even get an idea of what the bloody things are for. \\n\\nOnly catch is, once you’re inside the illusion, you won’t remember having been there before. Olesya swears it’s necessary. I think she’s just being a malevolent old baggage, but she’s the wizard. I just stand here nattering about the weather, or so she says.\\n\\nBut it’s not all bad.

	"lore_bw_deus_01": "The Coruscation Staff is the favoured weapon of choice for the indiscriminate Bright Wizard. Or perhaps that should be more indiscriminate? Of its two enchantments, the first unleashes a spray of magma fragments, short-ranged but understandably lethal. The second unleashes a storm of magma over a wide area, cooking all who stray within.\\nUnderstandably, companions may wish to give the Coruscation Staff’s handler plenty of room in which to operate. Not only are its enchantments founded on the principle of ‘quantity’ rather than ‘accuracy’, it overheats at a prodigious rate. More than one battle has turned for the worse following a Bright Wizard’s sudden explosion, and the immolation of their nearby allies. Nonetheless, the Coruscation Staff remains much sought after by the more … enthusiastic wizards.\\n",
	"lore_dr_deus_01": "The Grozthrund Trolldrengi – more commonly known as the Trollhammer Torpedo – is first and foremost employed by a hold’s ironbreakers. A modification of the Drakegun, it fires an armour-piercing explosive charge, capable of clearing hordes and dealing heavy damage to those who survive the initial blast. \\nIn the confines of a hold’s tunnels, it can be considered very much a weapon of last resort, for the explosion plays no favourites between dawi and other creatures. On the other hand, life-expectancy is seldom better in confined spaces if a troll is present, and to be an ironbreaker is to make selfless decisions for the good of the hold. Thanks to Bardin’s tinkering, his Trollhammers are easier to carry and marginally less self-destructive – a boon for the rest of the Ubersreik Five.\\n",
	"lore_es_deus_01": "The spear and shield may be humble, but it has many times been pivotal in the defence of not only the Empire, but many distant realms. Any fool can wield such a pairing – and indeed many have – but it takes years of skill and training to unlock the full potential of reach and defence that the combination enables. A dedicated spearman can best a far larger and stronger foe, so long as his weapons remain true.\\nIn the Empire, the spear is perhaps the most common of all weapons, save for the iconic halberd, and no mercenary worth his salt would dare claim himself a true soldier unless he has mastered it. \\n",
	"lore_huntsman_hat_1006": "Crafted from the remains of a shark that notoriously brought horror to the Marienburg harbour some years back, this headgear is surprisingly durable. It’s also surprisingly odorous, possessing a fishy stench that can curdle milk from several dozen yards upwind. \\nCuriously, immersion in water only makes the smell worse, as Kruber discovered when taking a swim in the River Bögen (for entirely mischievous purposes). Alas, forewarned – and not a little sickened – by the stench, the villagers fled for the safety of upwind climes, making the prank fall a little flat. All might have been well had that same aroma not lured a river troll out of its waterside cave, leading to the weaponless Kruber’s hasty and ignominious retreat. To add insult to injury, Sienna and Kerillian have since immortalised events in a brief but poignant romantic play, whose performance has been wholeheartedly embraced by the Bögen fisherfolk.\\n",
	"lore_ironbreaker_hat_1004": "While no dwarf will actually admit to an outsider of feeling self-conscious about their height, they often – and quite by coincidence – spend vast sums on hats designed to, ahem, increase their standing. As a result, Dwarfen battle-millinery is a fiercely competitive business, leading to some quite extraordinary designs. \\nThis particular piece, commissioned by Torri Gretson from the renowned Barak Varr smith Kreng Krengisson, was something of a legend in its day, and the tale was only enhanced further when Gretson’s heirs fell to squabbling over their father’s vanished helm. In the resulting unpleasantness, one fell off Steercrag Mountain, another took the Slayer Oath and the third left Barak Varr forever, never to be seen again. \\nBut the helm, at least, survives, kept safe by Gretson’s daughter Emalda, to whom it had secretly been bequeathed.\\n",
	"lore_knight_hat_0011": "Now that is a fine look, and no mistake. The noble brow, the stern features, and the picturesque scar left by the business end of a … I want to say ‘bear’, but around here, who knows? Frankly, I wouldn’t put it past Catrinne – she’s got a fearsome temper on her, and no impulse control. Always a bad combination. Not so practical in battle, I fear. That is, unless you’re relying on some fiendishly good looks to stop the enemy cold? Might work, I guess, but I reckon I’ll stick to a nice, solid steel helm. It’s served me well enough in the past.",
	"lore_maidenguard_hat_1004": "Ellyrian Reavers rove the wild lands of Ellyrion, slaying the monstrous beasts that leave the borders of the Annulii and seek to rampage through the Inner Kingdoms. Many a Cockatrice or Chimera has been laid low by the well-placed arrows or spear thrusts of the noble youths, and many more Dark Elves have had their cruel raids cut short. \\nIndeed, such pride do the Ellyrian Reavers take in their kills that many keep a tally of slain foes. When the sun sets and the fighting ceases, she whose spear has felled the greatest number of enemies is granted the honour of carrying the regiment's standard into the next battle. However, she who slays the mightiest opponent receives Kurnous' favour; when next she rides to war she does so as one of Kurnous' Harbingers, blessed with peerless aim by the wild god of the hunt.",
	"lore_mercenary_hat_1002": "It is well known in some quarters that the Emperor Karl-Franz is incredibly fond of hats. At least, so Kruber insists. \\nA topic Kruber is rather more vague on is how this particularly fine specimen escaped the Emperor’s personal vaults and came to Taal’s Horn Keep. But get him drunk enough – a non-inconsequential investment – and he’ll regale listeners with a story. Apparently, Marshal Erich Ludenwald, upon finding his life saved by a much younger – and soberer – Kruber, promised the young lad his prized hat as a reward. \\nAlas that very afternoon, Ludenwald found himself on the wrong end of an Orc’s choppa. Unaware (or uncaring) of pledges made, the Emperor claimed the splendid hat as a memento of his old friend… an injustice some unknowable and unseen hand has clearly righted.\\n",
	"lore_scholar_hat_1002": "All wizards have a fondness for candles. Spellcraft can be a challenging matter at the best of times, and a thousand cautionary tales warn against the rashness of sifting somatic components in the dark. Especially when one is an adept of Aqshy, and the difference between flammable and fireproof can prove a matter of life or attention-grabbing death. \\nThis particular collar was fashioned with safety in mind. The candles themselves are made from rendered dragon fat, and thus incredibly resistant to flame. When lit, they have a smell some describe as ‘burning history’ which, given the often great age of the dragons slain to make such candles a reality, can be said to be more literal statement that it first appears. \\nCertainly, dragons have no trouble recognising the aroma, meaning that while the bearer need fear no darkness, they might very well be advised to wariness of what lingers therein.\\n",
	"lore_scholar_hat_1003": "Bright Wizards are not especially known for their love of finery and flummeries, for such things are invariably the first to burn when the flames turn wrathful. Even so, one or two do invest in ostentatious fashion – though this, by its nature, is somewhat unique to their explosive calling.\\nThis particular helm is one such item, fashioned largely of glass to avoid metal’s well-documented interference with the magical arts. One happy side effect is that the myriad fiery reflections cause the helm’s facets to sparkle like gemstone, creating a pleasing display from little more than a Bright Wizard’s natural tendency to, shall we say, let off steam. Such crowns are particularly sought after, though not without risk. Should the glass grow too hot, the panels have a tendency to shatter … with unfortunate results for those nearby.\\n",
	"lore_shade_hat_1002": "Walk softly through the Ashen Hills. Such is the warning given to those who tread the barren wastes of Naggaroth. Even in that most dangerous of lands, the Ashen Hills hold a reputation for perils uncounted, for the vicious web of predators and prey has honed its denizens to the most vicious of killers. \\nNowhere is this truer among the outcast Shades of that province, who were blinded long ago in one of Malekith’s splendid fits of pique. Distrusted and unloved, even by their own kin, the druchii of the Ashen Hills delight in the stalking of prey. Unable to see, they track their victims by the sound of footfalls, and are seldom seen in return. At least, not before a wicked blade takes their victim’s throat or slips between their ribs… and by then, it’s rather too late.\\n",
	"lore_skin_bw_myrmidia": "In her aspect of the Goddess of Civilisation, Myrmidia tasks her faithful to uphold the precepts of law, for civilisation is nothing without such foundations. Her judges are unflinching in the pursuance of this duty. In criminal matters, they pay no heed to rank or wealth – there is only perpetrator, and victim. For though it is oft-forgotten, Myrmidia also holds herself to be a patron of the honourable, not merely the valiant.\\nAccordingly, Myrmidia’s judges are crossed only by the very arrogant or the very foolish. Both end the same way. The Goddess has little truck with dissembling and deception, and thus guilt or innocence are her judges’ only concerns. Fortunately, ashes seldom quibble about the severity of sentence.",
	"lore_skin_dr_irondrake": "Unsurprisingly, a good many ironbreakers revere Valaya above the other Ancestor Gods. After all, it falls to them to protect a hold’s hidden under-roads from the dwarfs’ most tenacious foes, selling their lives dearly against overwhelming numbers. This is a calling that comes from within, for there is little glory in the darkness, and few will ever know the mighty deeds performed within its grasp. \\nIndeed, ironbreakers perhaps best represent Valaya’s calling of ‘peace through war’ than any other cadre of dwarfs. Where their kin might fight for glory, for wealth or in the prosecution of old grudges, ironbreakers hold hearth and home precious above all. Such dedication is a virtue close to Valaya’s generous heart, and it is said that ale never tastes sweeter than in the darkness, surrounded by one’s doughty comrades.",
	"lore_skin_es_longshark": "Is it said that in the depths of the Great Forest, King Taal – the God of the Wilds and the Lord of Beasts – holds court. This is untrue, for Taal sees little need to trouble himself with the trappings of civilisation or worldly protocol. Nonetheless, there are those who consider themselves his heralds in the wider world. \\nSuch individuals are rare, but are welcomed to hovel and hearth across Talabecland and Stirland, where their arrival is viewed as proof of Taal’s favour, and a promise of bountiful hunting in the days ahead. Indeed, should such a village stand imperilled, once such Herald of Taal might even arrive to fight in its defence. Taal may be apart from civilisation, but he seldom forgets his faithful.\\n",
	"lore_skin_es_mercenary_1001": "Mercenaries like to stand out from the crowd, and the previous owner of this particular ensemble more than most. Though the garb is tattered and torn, the heraldry of many armies and mercenary bands can be glimpsed amid its rags … or so it appears. The truth is, this is no motley assemblage crafted by chance, but the remnant of a uniform deliberately commission by someone lacking either the good sense he was born with, or a pair of functioning eyes. \\nNonetheless, the uniform does make the wearer linger in the mind’s eye, if only out of pity. Once the Hellequin is glimpsed, it is not easily forgotten. It may, indeed, be the very thing Kruber is looking for (being the shy, self-effacing gent that he is…)\\n",
	"lore_skin_wh_bountyhunter_1001": "Of all the items in Lohner’s shop, there’s something about this one that just … catches the eye. Maybe it’s the cut of the fabric, the sheen of the silk. The lace ruff, perhaps? Or the gilded edging that sparkles like the sun? It is a masterwork of haberdashery, as impressive in its way as the toughest ironbreaker’s plate, or the delicate fletching on an elven arrow. It doesn't belong in this world, and its implicit promise is that if you wear it, nor will you … and everyone will know it.\\nBut the greatest mystery of all – one that takes cruel injustice to new heights – is the fact that this wonderous garb fits no one so perfectly as Victor Saltzpyre, who considers fine garb second only to bathing in the pursuit of hedonistic mores…\\n",
	"lore_skin_wh_flagellant": "So many years have passed since Sigmar ascended to godhood that it is almost impossible to understand how a barbarian king famed for his wisdom and valour has spawned a religion based on madness and degradation. And yet, this is precisely what has happened, for none worship Sigmar so fervently as those willing to surrender themselves to cleansing pain.\\nFlagellants despair of a world sliding into sin and heresy, and buttress their own faltering will through the application of the brand, and the lash. Pain, they believe, brings not only clarity, but fortitude – even godliness. Nothing scares such men. After all, what can the enemy possibly do to them that they have not already done to themselves?\\n",
	"lore_skin_ww_moonmantle": "Priestesses of Lileath hold a revered position in Ulthuani and Asrai societies, but also a distrusted one. Their motives – like those of their goddess – are not always as transparent as others might wish. While it is accorded a great honour to have a priestess attend the birth of a child or the coronation of a monarch, there is always a lingering suspicion as to what exactly the significance of her gifts – and her words – might hold.\\nNo such doubts are present, however, if a priestess of Lileath deigns to join a battle line. There is only the certainty that the struggle to come is somehow pivotal in the elven race’s long battle for survival. Where walks a priestess, Lileath’s gaze is sure to follow.\\n",
	"lore_skin_ww_shade_1001": "The commission, fulfilment and expectation of assassination are merely a facet of daily life in the realm of Naggaroth. One must be forever alert for the possibility a rival – or even a chance acquaintance – judging your survival less valuable than the quantity of coin its curtailment will cost. Assassins themselves are therefore common to the point of expendability, and commissions jealously contested by whatever advantage can be sought.\\nGarb is one such advantage. Naggarothi assassins favour raiment that moves easily, presents the wearer with a degree of enviable style – on those few occasions where she wishes to be seen – and above all, blends with the shadows. This particular ensemble – until recently – belonged to a traveller come seeking Lohner. Kerillian intercepted him before contact could be made, and has since taken pains to keep Lohner ignorant of his almost-brush with death…\\n",
	"lore_we_deus_01": "The Moonfire Bow is a gift from Lileath herself, an enchanted weapon that summons arrows of cold, blue flame to vanquish the wielder’s enemies. As one might expect from a godly weapon, it requires no mortal arrows to fire – though it does take a toll of the user’s willpower each time an arrow is loosed. By concentrating on the target, the wielder can even summon forth a mightier shot!\\nAs with all of Lileath’s gifts, whatever purpose the Moonfire Bow serves for its wielder, it doubtless serves the goddess threefold. The Druchii of Naggaroth, who have little love for Lileath, believe that such gifts hold a subtle, insidious influence over the wielder, directing them to means and ends of which the Goddess approves. Then again, the Druchii have never much approved of anything subtle or insidious that is not their own doing …\\n",
	"lore_wh_deus_01": "The Griffon-Foot is a rare and oft-derided invention, expensive to forge, a daemon to maintain and slow to reload. On the other hand, it packs ferocious firepower across a wide area, making death – or at least a powerful bellyache – inevitable for all who are caught in its path. \\nFortunately, the slow reload can be mitigated by carrying several fully-loaded Griffon-foot pistols and simply switching to another whenever one is spent. This makes for an expensive proposition – rare as they are, only a fellow with prodigious wealth or far-reaching contacts would be fortunate enough to lay his hands on more than a single weapon. That Saltzpyre has managed this feat shows unusual reach. Perhaps Lohner is the responsible party?\\n",

	"nfl_gorge_intro_03": "I wouldn't drink the water down there if I were you. But no one listens to me ...",
	"nfl_holly_illusion_waystone_01": "Don't mind the lack of the cart. Enter the portal - it's perfectly safe.",
	"nfl_holly_illusion_waystone_02": "What's the delay? Use the portal. Oh, that's right. You've forgotten. You'll just have to trust me.",
	"nfl_holly_illusion_waystone_03": "Head for the portal - that'll break the illusion. Should I have said that? They're not supposed to know about that while they're in the illusion...",
	"nfl_holly_level_another_memory_01": "That's not right. I'm sure that's not right...",
	"nfl_holly_level_another_memory_03": "I don't remember it like this, not at all.",

	"nfl_holly_level_combat_01": "No showing off now! We're not here to play stab-the-most pact-sworn.",
	"nfl_holly_level_combat_03": "Stand ready! They're coming for you again!",
	"nfl_holly_level_memory_chaos_01": "Why are the northlanders here? I think I might have broken the illusion...",
	"nfl_holly_level_memory_chaos_04": "Some Rotblood shaman's been messing with my magic. That's why we've got chaos worshippers in Ubersreik.",
	"nfl_holly_level_wrong_way_01": "Imbeciles! You're going the wrong way!",
	"nfl_holly_level_wrong_way_02": "No. This isn't it. Try something else. A different direction.",
	"nfl_holly_level_wrong_way_03": "Wrong way, imbeciles. Honestly, I'd do better with a flock of headless chickens.",
	"nfl_holly_lodestone_01": "You remember that peculiar dwarfen trinket you found while off gallivanting? Well, I think I know what it is... Well, mostly. It's a sort of map, I suppose. There are other runes beyond the ones you can see - though I wouldn't expect you to have the wit to know that. So what does the trinket show the way to? I'm not sure. But whatever it is lies back in Ubersreik. Makes me think we missed something back in the day. We were busy.",
	"nfl_holly_lodestone_02": "So here's what I propose. I happen to know a handy illusion spell. I can use it to recreate Ubersreik as it was, so you merry fellows can have a look around. The runes have told me roughly where to start - there are three sites in all, and I imagine three runes to be found. I'm sure it'll all go off without complication. Oh... one tiny detail. The illusion will be so complete that you'll quite forget you were ever there before. It'll all be new to you. Better that way, otherwise your little brains might snap. But don't worry, I'll be there to guide you... (laugh)",
	"nfl_holly_lodestone_found_01": "Now what is that I see? An unusual thing for one of the pact-sworn to have been lugging around. Don't damage it! I'll want to have a good look when you bring it home. Which reminds me: bring it home!",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_solved_01": "Aha! You know, I had a bet with Lohner about whether you'd find the rune. He'll be smug for days, but at least we've our answers.",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_solved_02": "A passable job, but it's done now. One rune, one step closer to solving the mystery.",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_solved_03": "That's the way. I knew you'd find the rune... eventually. Who knows? We might even solve this mystery.",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_solved_04": "I'm not impressed, but you found the rune. That counts for something.",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_unsolved_01": "All that searching and nothing! But we can't waste any more time. You'll have to come back and try again.",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_unsolved_02": "Why oh why do I place my faith in you? Find one little rune, that's all I asked. Maybe next time, eh?",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_unsolved_03": "What's the matter? Were all the little beasties too scary? Stopped you finding the rune? You'll just have to come back!",
	"nfl_holly_mystery_unsolved_04": "This is what I get for trusting you useless lot. You're coming straight back! Again and again until you find what we need.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_01": "I've fought my share of battles, but I'll leave this one out. Wouldn't want to overshadow you.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_02": "This is a miserable situation, but we gospodars are used to hardship.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_03": "I heard one of Lohner's boys speak of this as the 'End Times'. Hah! Every day is like this back in Kislev!",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_04": "If the world really is coming to an end, I'll not hide away here. I'll meet it on horseback, with a sword in hand!",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_05": "Don't mock me. You'll be old one day - if you're very fortunate.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_06": "I may be old, but I see clearly enough. We've dark days ahead.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_07": "Never liked axes. Not since the Battle of Gutaidra. Nearly lost an arm.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_08": "The old Tsar? He liked a drink, and a laugh.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_09": "Lohner? He and I go back a few years. Honest enough if you can keep him in sight. Daresay he'd say the same about me.",
	"nfl_hub_backstory_10": "Lohner claims to be only an innkeeper? And you believe him?",
	"nfl_hub_banter_kept_alive": "Ever wonder why Rasknitt kept you alive? Ah, this is... Hehe... this is funny. He has convinced himself... Hehehe... that you lot are among the greatest of the Empire's heroes! Hahahaha! Great heroes! Haha! You! Hahahaha! Ah yes, he was going to offer all of you to the Rotbloods, his new pact-friends, as a grand gift for them to sacrifice. So there you have it.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_01": "What're you looking so cheerful about?",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_02": "Up and about at last?",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_03": "Show a bit of urgency. Do you not know there's a war on?",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_04": "At last. I thought you'd never show your faces.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_05": "Not a word of greeting? Suit yourselves.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_06": "A terrible thing, it is, for our fates to hang on the likes of you.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_07": "Oh, there you are.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_08": "Not even a smile? Miserable lot.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_09": "What was Lohner thinking, relying on you?",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_10": "Keep it down, won't you? I have a headache.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_11": "And hello to you, too.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_12": "Look at the state of you.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_13": "No greeting for an old woman?",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_14": "Here at last, eh?",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_15": "And about time too.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_16": "There you are. At last.",

	"nfl_hub_greeting_18": "Adequate, that's what you are.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_19": "You're late. Again.",
	"nfl_hub_greeting_20": "And here they are. Lag-a-beds, every one of you.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_01": "My homeland's overrun, that's what I'm hearing. So what? It's always overrun, and we always take it back. This is nothing different.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_02": "Wouldn't last a week in Kislev, none of you. Eaten by bears, with only bones left to show.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_03": "Show what weak gods you have down here. Ursun wouldn't stand for this nonsense.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_04": "If these Reiklanders had half the heart of a Kossar, this war would be over by now.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_05": "I miss the snows. And the ice glinting on the River Lynsk.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_06": "Lohner tells me that Queen Katarin's missing. She'll pull through. Tougher than her father, that one, and he was a mountain.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_07": "What manner of countryside is this? The land around here's no good for riding.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_08": "Why are you still standing around?",
	"nfl_hub_idle_09": "Have you nothing better to do than loiter?",
	"nfl_hub_idle_10": "You're wasting time, and we've precious little as it is.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_11": "No sense of urgency, you young folk.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_12": "Things are getting desperate out there.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_13": "It's a terrible thing to think the Reikland's relying on you.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_14": "Think I'm weak, do you? Lend me a sword, you'll see.",
	"nfl_hub_idle_15": "Takes a lot of concentration, keeping the Bridge open.",

	"nfl_hub_idle_17": "Elven magic. Well, we all make sacrifices, don't we?",
	"nfl_hub_idle_18": "Will one of you tell Sergeant Kruber I'm still waiting to be swept off my feet?",
	"nfl_hub_idle_19": "Where's the gallant sergeant? Don't tell me he's hiding from me again?",
	"nfl_hub_idle_20": "Now where's my bonnie sergeant gone?",
	"nfl_hub_olesya_conversation_eighteen_01": "Always wanted to visit Athel Loren, but worried I'd fetch an arrow for my trouble.",
	"nfl_hub_olesya_conversation_eight_01": "Have you ever travelled as far north as Kislev, Goreksson?",
	"nfl_hub_olesya_conversation_eleven_01": "No respect. None of you, except for the elf. But I'll outlast you all.",
	"nfl_hub_olesya_conversation_fifteen_01": "We'll be fine, you and I. Long as we keep our respect.",
	"nfl_hub_olesya_conversation_five_01": "I do like your hat, Saltzpyre. Can I have it when you're dead?",

The Order of the Reikshammer fought off a night of skaven assassinations and a follow up assault. They gave the ratmen a real kicking apparently. But en route to Helmgart, the whole Order, not that there were many of them, were surrounded by massive horde of the Rotbloods.

And I can't help noticing, that you've added some peculiar weapons to your arsenal lately...",
	"nik_hub_lohner_conversation_sh_two_01": "I should have heeded your advice, but it came much too late, I'm afraid. Lost some good lads near that village I told you about.

	"nik_hub_story_02": "Alright, there's no good way to deliver bad news, but here I go. Shortly before my messages arrived in Altdorf, the Emperor and his whole combined army marched north. They're off to face a massive chaos incursion. Yes, we're all alone. Again. The towns not yet touched by the pact invasion refuse to spare a single soldier of their garrison, and the ones unfortunate enough to taste the fury of the Rotbloods and Clan Fester, have nothing but dead to offer us. History repeats itself, friends. Once again, it's all up to us. But... we did it before. We can do it again.",
	"nik_hub_story_03": "Bravo, people! Another evil lord sent to hell! And the good news doesn't stop there! Olesya's gathered enough information about the Skittergate, so now we know how to get rid of it for good. And not only that, the bloody thing is vulnerable now, since all your killing and blowing things up have caused tension among the enemy ranks. The Skittergate is less well guarded, and even better, that cursed Grey Seer Rasknitt and his entourage is off to some rat mass-rally. Celebrating their victory I presume. I know you lot want to get your hands on that bastard, but what better way to ruin their party than to blow up their Skittergate? Eh? Remember, we do have a war to win.",
	"nik_hub_story_end_01": "What can I say? What in Sigmar's, Ranald's, and Karl Franz name can I say? You did it again! Against all odds, omens, rats and northlander muck, you fought your way to Norsca and ended Rasknitt and his grand plan in one elegant swoop. I'm running out of words here, people. Listen, I'll bring out the casks and barrels and perhaps maybe that'll get me going again...",

	"nik_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01_new_champ": "We've a new Rotblood Champion, people. There's always a new one popping up, whatever you kill in this world. A large force of northlanders are out raiding, while some left for Helmgart, so I think we have a fine opportunity to grind their morale into the dust by killing off their glorious new leader. Wish I could say it'll be easier this time, but what's life without a bit of challenge, eh?",
	"nik_loading_screen_chaos_war_camp_01_ribspreader": "Looks like we've made a friend. After freeing his slaves, burning his supplies, and burying his dreams of power, Bödvarr Ribspreader is more than eager to socialize.

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_cargo_elevator_03": "There's the lift. Took us long enough. Let's hope the ride down's faster.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_cargo_elevator_04": "That's the guildsmen's lift... Over there!",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_complete_01": "Finally, that foul tooth-hole spews no more. Excellent, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_complete_02": "Yes! That was good, darlings! Halescourge's finally gone. Ooh, I like it when they die.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_complete_03": "What a mess, but it's glorious all the same!",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_complete_04": "We've done it, darlings! No more tree, no more daemonic plants!",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_01": "Slice that rope. It'll fell the bridge.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_02": "Sever the moorings and the bridge will fall.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_03": "Sliced ropes will get us a crossing point, darlings.",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_get_clear_01": "That's it! Get away before it blows!",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_get_clear_04": "Run, darlings! It's going to blow!",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_01": "There it is. Horrible, isn't it?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_02": "And that's our daemon-tree. Ugly thing.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_03": "There's the daemon-tree. Turns your stomach, doesn't it.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_04": "That's the daemon-tree, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_01": "There must be a way to destroy it.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_02": "I'm not sure our blades will hurt it much.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_03": "We can't beat it to death, that's for certain.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_04": "It'll take more than flames and foul language to kill this.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_01": "What about black powder?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_02": "It looks hungry. Let's feed it explosives.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_03": "What if we destroy it from within? With black powder?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_04": "If we cannot destroy it from without, why not from within? With explosives.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_01": "Greedy beastie, isn't it?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_02": "That's it, darlings, the tree's gorging.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_03": "Good tree. Nice tree. Swallow your medicine whole.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_04": "Barely touched the sides. Feed it another.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_response_01": "It doesn't belong in this world.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_response_02": "Have a care. The tree's more aware than it lets on.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_response_03": "Let's burn it to ash!",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_response_04": "That pus... It's too sodden to burn.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_01": "Don't go around the vines! Cut them down!",

	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_six_01_x": "So a daemon-tree of Nurgle awaits us, eh?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_story_six_x": "Not exactly, darling. But I am curious. To see if it burns.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_town_01": "From everything we've heard, I expected more damage.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_town_02": "This doesn't look so bad... I thought the Skaven had levelled Helmgart?",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_town_03": "This is more intact that I expected.",
	"pbw_level_ground_zero_town_04": "We sure we're in the right place? This looks relatively intact.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_01a": "Did that door just blow open?",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_02a": "Who, or what, made that door vanish?",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_03a": "Oh, no more door. Looks like we've a way out, darlings.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04a": "Fancy that. The temple completely removed the door for us. Overkill, but still nice.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_01": "If we're going through that gate, we need to set that capstan going.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_02": "See that capstan? That's our way forward.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_03": "Darlings? We can't pass through a closed portcullis. We need it open. Maybe that capstan?",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_portcullis_04": "We can't move forward! Someone knock that capstan loose!",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_eleven_01": "I can't help but wonder if Helmgart would have been better off with more coin spent on defence, and less on temples.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_eleven_02": "Can't win if everyone's dead, either.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_four_01": "Come out, pact-sworn! I need something to burn!",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_four_02": "What? Can't a woman enjoy burning an enemy or two?",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_nine_01": "Is the Reikland always so turbulent?",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_nine_02": "A Witch Hunter's answer. Guilty until proven more guilty.",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_seven_01": "And by 'words', you don't really mean 'words', do you?",
	"pbw_level_helmgart_military_story_two_01": "I could set the temple ablaze, if you think that would help?",
	"pbw_level_mine_found_cart_first_01": "There you are! Cheeky little cart.",
	"pbw_level_mine_found_cart_first_02": "There you are! Who's a good little cart? That's right, you are...",
	"pbw_level_mine_found_cart_first_03": "There's our cart. I knew it wouldn't have gone far.",
	"pbw_level_mine_found_cart_first_04": "See, darlings? There's our cart, safe and sound.",
	"pbw_level_mine_story_eight_01": "We're not here to stake a claim.",
	"pbw_level_mine_story_five_01": "Makes you wonder what else we've in store.",
	"pbw_level_mine_story_four_01": "They'll turn on each other before long, such is the way of our enemies.",
	"pbw_level_mine_story_four_03": "On this, and very little else.",
	"pbw_level_mine_story_four_04": "...so we have to endure. It is what it is.",

	"pbw_level_mine_story_two_01": "Can it be? Is our valiant dwarf scared?",
	"pbw_level_mine_troll_food_storage_01": "Revolting. I think we've found their larder.",
	"pbw_level_mine_troll_food_storage_02": "No wonder the trolls vomit all the time.",
	"pbw_level_mine_troll_food_storage_03": "Looks like they've been feeding plague monks to the trolls.",
	"pbw_level_mine_troll_food_storage_04": "Is that...? They've been feeding the trolls on plague monks!",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_01": "Poor devil. Took a wrong turn in the swamp, and look what happened.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_02": "Not the site I'd have chosen to catch up on my sleep.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_03": "Dark magics have been practiced here. Don't touch the body.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_04": "Hands off the body, darlings. You don't know where it's been.",

	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_02": "We've wrecked this batch, darlings. More revulsion next door, perhaps?",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_03": "I'd say we're done here, darlings. We should look for more nastiness to smash elsewhere.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_one_destroyed_04": "Oh, darlings, I'd say that's all of them busted open! Look for more!",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_01": "More daemonic weak spots cracked open! Search for more, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_02": "That's another batch done! Seems like we're making progress, darlings!",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_03": "Oh, this cave is cleared, darlings. Good smashing!",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_cluster_two_destroyed_04": "One less group of clusters, darlings. I think it's working!",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_01": "This isn't our destination, darlings. These workings are too old.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_02": "Shame. I thought this might be it, but they're too long done with.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_03": "These delvings are old. We'll have to keep looking.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_04": "This isn't the right place. It's been abandoned for years.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_01": "Let's find the portal, and get out of this muck.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_02": "Where's the portal. I've had as much of this as I can take.",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_03": "Feels like half the swamp's sticking to my boots. Can we go now?",
	"pbw_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_04": "Look out for the portal, darlings. It'll be here somewhere.",
	"pbw_level_prologue_almost_there_01": "Fresh air! That feels good.",

	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_02": "Valaya's Tankard. That looks like a gobbo... With one too many legs...",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_03": "That a gobbo, drengbarazi? Wonder how it got here. And how it got the extra leg.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_goblin_04": "Only good gobbo is a dead gobbo, dawri. Number of legs doesn't come into it.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_01": "Having a good time over there, dawri. Still, it's not a party until someone cleaves a gobbo in two.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_02": "Not a one comes out to help. Ogling the fireworks, I suppose. Useless bunch.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_03": "Call those fireworks? Umgak everywhere, as usual. Wouldn't mind, but they might come out and lend a hand.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_noisy_04": "Grungni's Beard! No wonder we've no help with all that going on.",

	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_01": "Who has time for reading? Songs, dawri - that's how you pass on the good stuff.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_02": "Now, let's - just this once - be careful with our flames. This place'll go up like a gobbo with a rocket up its arse.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_03": "Never seen the appeal of books, myself. Especially ones that whisper to you the whole time.",
	"pdr_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_books_04": "So, what was a fine upstanding priest doing with this little lot, eh?",
	"pdr_level_catacombs_mist_01": "I can't see one foot in front of the other!",
	"pdr_level_catacombs_mist_02": "Where'd this blasted mist come from?",

	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_01": "I smell an ambush!",

	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_03": "Grimnir's beard! I've seen gobbos build to last better than this!",
	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_04": "Keep your eyes on the shacks, drengbarazi.",
	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_01": "The kazaki'dum have been busy raising defences. Good job they're not finished.",
	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_02": "Good job they didn't have these towers further out, eh?",
	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_03": "Glad we didn't leave this for later - the camp's growing all the time.",
	"pdr_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_04": "Call that a watchtower? Where are its barag? Its parapets?",
	"pdr_level_fort_and_again_01": "A good hit, but it needs another.",
	"pdr_level_fort_and_again_02": "The umgak thing's still standing.",
	"pdr_level_fort_and_again_03": "Hit home, but the machine's still upright. We need to fire again.",

	"pdr_level_fort_barrel_fouled_01": "Umgak manling... (mutter) Where's the other cannon?",
	"pdr_level_fort_barrel_fouled_02": "Useless, worthless, umgak! We need the other cannon.",
	"pdr_level_fort_barrel_fouled_03": "What wazzok built this umgak? Good job there's another cannon.",
	"pdr_level_fort_barrel_fouled_04": "Just like a manling cannon. Useless after one shot. What of the other?",
	"pdr_level_fort_cannonballs_03": "We're out of cannonballs! Find some, dawri!",

	"pdr_level_fort_clear_courtyard_04": "Oho! Looks like the northlanders are still wanting a fight!",
	"pdr_level_fort_complete_01": "Another fine job, if I say so myself.",
	"pdr_level_fort_complete_02": "That's the fort saved, dawri. Reinforcements'll be here soon.",
	"pdr_level_fort_complete_03": "A fortress saved, and a righteous thumping handed out. A good day's work.",
	"pdr_level_fort_complete_04": "This'll hold without us, now tithe siege is broken. And I want an ale or twelve.",
	"pdr_level_fort_confirmation_01": "Very well, manling!",
	"pdr_level_fort_confirmation_02": "What? He thinks we can't manage that?",
	"pdr_level_fort_confirmation_03": "Be a pleasure, manling!",
	"pdr_level_fort_confirmation_04": "Too easy! I wanted a challenge!",

	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_final_hit_03": "Whohoo! Many a dongliz blown to the skies! I love you all, dawri!",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_final_hit_04": "A grand sight, and no mistake!",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_first_03": "Aim that poor excuse of a cannon, dawri. If it can't deal with raki umgak, I lose all hope in you, manlings.",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_first_04": "The cannon needs aiming, dawri. I think we all can see the benefits of blasting that catapult.",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_first_hit_03": "By Grimnir, a fine shot and no mistake! Haha! Raki umgak.",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_first_hit_04": "Haha! A flash, a roar, and raki dead! Good stuff, dawri!",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_fuse_is_lit_03": "Here we go, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_fuse_is_lit_04": "We're firing, dawri!",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_second_03": "They got more umgak on the move. Remind them of our cannon, dawri. Their scrambled raki brains forget so easily.",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_second_04": "Another target, another shot needed, dawri! Haha, I can do this all day, should they wish!",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_second_hit_03": "Haha! Did you see those raki fly, drengbarazi? Well, neither did I, but I imagined it vividly!",
	"pdr_level_fort_fire_cannon_second_hit_04": "Oh, dawri, I think I found a new friend in our cannon here! He's not dawi of course, but anyone killing raki like that, can drink with me!",
	"pdr_level_fort_gate_fallen_03": "That sounded like they breached the fortress gate, dawri. We're running out of time!",
	"pdr_level_fort_gate_fallen_04": "Gate's fallen. dawri. Let's hope that word has reached the defenders that heroes are inbound! It should steel their defence!",
	"pdr_level_fort_getting_closer_03": "Ha! We made it. So what about this secret path?",
	"pdr_level_fort_getting_closer_04": "Come on, dawri. We've a secret passage to find.",
	"pdr_level_fort_get_back_on_road_01": "Reckon we're past the blockage, dawri. Shall we return to the road?",
	"pdr_level_fort_get_back_on_road_02": "Road's clear now. We should be up there.",
	"pdr_level_fort_get_back_on_road_03": "That road looks clear. Is there a path back up?",
	"pdr_level_fort_get_back_on_road_04": "Road looks clear to me. See if there's a way back up, would you?",
	"pdr_level_fort_jump_down_01": "Off the road, dawri. We'll find another way around.",
	"pdr_level_fort_jump_down_02": "We'll have to leave the road, take a scenic route.",
	"pdr_level_fort_jump_down_03": "Well, the road was fine enough while it lasted.",
	"pdr_level_fort_jump_down_04": "Boots into the wilderness. That road's not leading us anywhere.",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_destroyed_01": "Hah! That showed them!",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_destroyed_02": "Catapult's matchwood! Good work, dawri!",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_destroyed_03": "What's the matter, raki? Your toys broken?",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_destroyed_04": "That did the job! Hah!",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_shelling_01": "That kruting catapult's still firing!",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_shelling_02": "Gas! Must be the plague claw.",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_shelling_03": "(cough) Boga! The plague claw's still firing!",

	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_shelling_alert_04": "It's raining toxic sludge, dawri, watch out!",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_shelling_move_03": "Move, drengbarazi! Only raki poison here!",
	"pdr_level_fort_plague_claw_shelling_move_04": "Press on, dawri! We're nothing but target practice for their catapults here!",
	"pdr_level_fort_powder_and_shot_01": "Powder and shot. Quickly, dawri. Quickly.",
	"pdr_level_fort_powder_and_shot_02": "Hmmm. We need powder and shot.",
	"pdr_level_fort_powder_and_shot_03": "Can't fire this without powder and shot.",
	"pdr_level_fort_powder_and_shot_04": "We'll need black powder and a mite of shot to make this work.",
	"pdr_level_fort_push_them_back_01": "To the Outer Courtyard, dawri! Charge like Okri when he charged against the Red-backed Scoffingbird!",
	"pdr_level_fort_push_them_back_02": "I know how to hold a fort, dawri. We must take the outer courtyard! Push the pact-skruff back!",
	"pdr_level_fort_push_them_back_03": "We won't win unless we hold the Outer Courtyard, dawri! Charge!",
	"pdr_level_fort_push_them_back_04": "Push the cess-drinkers back, drengbarazi! Take the Outer Courtyard!",
	"pdr_level_fort_river_03": "Here's where we go upriver, dawri. We'll have us a crossing soon.",
	"pdr_level_fort_river_04": "The crossing point's upriver, dawri. Then we find the secret entrance.",
	"pdr_level_fort_skaven_everywhere_03": "I guess these wazzocks think they're winning?! Let's make our presence known, drengbarazi!",
	"pdr_level_fort_skaven_everywhere_04": "Pact-raki, pact-dumi, pact-pig stickers, hah, I'll give you all a royal drubbing!",
	"pdr_level_fort_skaven_run_01": "The raki are running!",
	"pdr_level_fort_skaven_run_02": "Grimnir's Axe! The raki are running!",
	"pdr_level_fort_skaven_run_03": "Can't take any more, raki?",
	"pdr_level_fort_skaven_run_04": "Run, vermin! A dawi's too much for you!",
	"pdr_level_fort_spotting_portal_01": "There's the portal. Last one there gets left behind!",
	"pdr_level_fort_spotting_portal_02": "I see the portal. We'll soon be gone.",
	"pdr_level_fort_spotting_portal_03": "Wish we didn't have to leave the mountains so soon...",
	"pdr_level_fort_spotting_portal_04": "Is it time to go already? I was just getting started, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_fort_this_is_it_01": "There. Pact-sworn in the passages ahead. We ought to do the umgak place a favour with a touch of elegant blood splatter, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_fort_this_is_it_02": "Here we are, hot on the heels of the pact-sworn,. Or they're on the heels of us, Doesn't matter - they'll die the same.",
	"pdr_level_fort_this_is_it_03": "Thank Grungni! Feared I'd have to hack my own kruting entrance. Looks like someone beat me to it.",
	"pdr_level_fort_this_is_it_04": "Secret entrance not very secret, dawri. The raki have a snout for such things.",
	"pdr_level_fort_under_attack_03": "The raki don't know proper siegecraft, but they do have the numbers. And catapults. And kruti tunnels. (sigh)",
	"pdr_level_fort_under_attack_04": "I've seen many a fortress swarmed like this. Catapults are only the start. We don't have long.",
	"pdr_level_fort_use_cannons_03": "The raki catapults must go, dawri. We'll have to use the manling cannon.",
	"pdr_level_fort_use_cannons_04": "Those cannons still intact, dawri? They're an answer to the raki catapult problem.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_01": "Keep fighting, drengbarazi! He's not walking away from this!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_02": "Fall, dumi! A dawi never yields!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_03": "He's weakening! Hit him again!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_04": "Fight on, dawri! He has to die!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_boss_spotted_01": "Oh, I'll give you something, dumi! A beating loud enough to wake the ancestors.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_boss_spotted_02": "Sorcerer Lord, eh? What a dongliz. Just kill him, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_complete_04": "You smell that? Kruti smells even worse with his head split open.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_01": "We need the bridge down. Someone split that rope.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_02": "Get that bridge down, dawri. See the rope?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_03": "Can we get yon bridge down? Must be a rope around here somewhere.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_04": "Here! Now, if there was a way to split the bridge's anchor... Maybe a rope?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_get_clear_01": "Time to fall back, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_get_clear_02": "Better step away. This'll be messy.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_get_clear_03": "We're about to get a shower of unspeakables, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_get_clear_04": "Get clear! And don't breathe in!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_01": "So that's the tree?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_02": "There it is. Ugly brute, isn't it?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_03": "Boga! I've seen some ugly trees in my time, but that one?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_04": "That's the tree? Looks like dung with teeth.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_01": "We might have to be clever about this one.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_02": "I'm not sure we can win this one with steel, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_03": "It's a mite big for our usual methods, don't you think?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_04": "So... How do we deal with that?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_01": "What am I using for brains...? Black powder! That's the answer!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_02": "Well, when an axe isn't enough, that's when we turn to black powder.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_03": "Looks hungry. How about we feed it some black powder?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_04": "We could always feed it some black powder. Can't hurt. Well, can't hurt us.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_01": "Looks like it's working.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_02": "Just as well that tree's not very clever, eh?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_03": "I guess it's eaten worse.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_its_working_04": "Like a gobbo in a barrel of rotten apples. Keep going!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_response_01": "Won't last long against us, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_response_02": "We'll find a way to shift it, drengbarazi.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_response_03": "Well, no sense staring. We've work to do.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_response_04": "Less gawping, more action, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_01": "Hack your way through!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_02": "Split the vines!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_03": "The vines'll part. Give 'em a whack or two!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_04": "I'll not be thwarted by a few rotten vines!",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_story_five_01": "Daemon-trees? Well, what's the world coming to?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_story_five_02": "You may be right, wutelgi, but no sense giving up now, eh?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_town_01": "Doesn't look too bad from up here, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_town_02": "Is it me, or does Helmgart look salvageable from here?",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_town_03": "Not too much damage. Bit of work, this town'll be a going concern again.",
	"pdr_level_ground_zero_town_04": "Town's taken a few knocks, but they'll rebuild, drengbarazi.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_01": "Door's open. That's our cue to leave.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_02": "We have an open door. Best make use of it, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_03": "Grungni's Bitter Breath! That door opened by itself!",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_door_opens_04": "How'd that door open? Never mind. We need a way out.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_four_01": "...psychotic...",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_nine_01": "What kind of answer's that?",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_six_01": "Of course. Though most go better with a drop of Bugman's. Especially the one about Okri and the Troll Queen.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_six_02": "Amorous, more like - though you're not to tell Okri I said that.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_ten_01": "You ever wonder what's going on back home, wutelgi?",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_ten_02": "Typical elf, seeing things in absolutes.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_ten_03": "From time to time. When I can bear to.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_three_01": "Why is it you manlings don't guard against the Skaven? You've strong enough walls to keep out greenskins and beastmen.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_three_02": "Is that so? Not sure there's anyone keeping the secret in Helmgart. Not any longer.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_twelve_01": "Could be a good little fortress, this town.",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_twelve_02": "Oh aye. But with good dawi walls, and stern dawi shields atop them...",
	"pdr_level_helmgart_military_story_twelve_03": "Not how I'd have put it, but close enough.",
	"pdr_level_mine_found_cart_first_01": "Oho! There's our cart.",
	"pdr_level_mine_found_cart_first_02": "Dawri! I've found the cart!",
	"pdr_level_mine_found_cart_first_03": "There it is! We can stop searching!",
	"pdr_level_mine_found_cart_first_04": "There's the cart!",
	"pdr_level_mine_gloat_01": "Bits of troll everywhere. Do we have time for a quick stew?",
	"pdr_level_mine_gloat_02": "Waste of good troll meat, that is.",
	"pdr_level_mine_gloat_03": "Keep an eye our for a liver. Best bit on a troll, except for the toes.",
	"pdr_level_mine_gloat_04": "You see that? (laugh) Never thought the pieces would go so far.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_eight_01": "What were they mining down here, anyway?",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_eight_02": "Speak for yourself. A dawi's always ready to stake a claim.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_eight_03": "Ah, but dwarfs are a dab hand at keeping trolls out. Or at least close enough to provide a good stew.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_eleven_01": "Strange question. Why do you live above it?",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_eleven_02": "There you go. Normal for us isn't the same as normal for you.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_eleven_a_01": "So, Kruber Why is it you can't grow a proper beard?",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_nine_01": "Aye. It's the tallow. Like chewing on a troll's finger.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_nine_02": "We can't all eat roots and leaves.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_nine_03": "Only that she thinks Grimgi's the one stealing them.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_one_01": "Just look at this place. How manlings can work down here, I'll never know.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_one_02": "How can it be? It's as likely to come down on us as stay up.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_one_03": "You keep to chasing your heretics, Grimgi, and leave the mining to me, alright?",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_seven_01": "Do me a favour, dawri. Keep an eye out for a gromril seam. You never know...",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_seven_02": "You can talk. Or are you not getting paid?",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_seven_a_01": "Wouldn't dare. Nor would you, if you'd seen her wield a hammer.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_ten_01": "Tomatoes. Poisonous to trolls, or so Okri said. Mind you, he was in a funny mood.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_ten_02": "And you reckon you can lay your hands on some tomatoes, rotten or otherwise?",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_twelve_01": "We've all got secrets Azumgi. Even Saltzpyre.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_two_01": "We'll want to tread carefully down here, dawri. A cornered troll's a terrible thing.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_two_02": "Aye, just don't say I didn't warn you.",
	"pdr_level_mine_story_two_03": "Cautious, that's all, Zharrinn. Better to guard your wealth than mourn its loss, as... a cousin of mine used to say.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_01": "Look at that one. Funny place for a nap.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_02": "Looks like this poor wazzok took a wrong turn.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_03": "Oi! Wonder how he ended up here?",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_altar_corpse_04": "This one? Sleeping the sleep of the foully murdered, from the looks of it.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_barrier_01": "Break through, dawri. We've no time for delay.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_barrier_02": "Stopped by a flimsy obstacle like that? I think not, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_barrier_03": "Smash through, drengbarazi. Time's a-wasting.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_barrier_04": "Give it a tap or two, dawri. It'll lets us through.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_01": "Old workings, dawri. And not Skaven-work. Keep going.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_02": "Looks like manling work, dawri. And it's too recent to be what we're after.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_03": "Don't get your hopes up, dawri. This is all too knew.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mine_tunnel_04": "Now, these are mine workings alright, but they're not what we're looking for.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_01": "Good work, dawri. Now let's have a look for that portal.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_02": "Could be the lot comes down. Let's be away before that happens.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_03": "Don't like the look of that roof. We should get going.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_mission_accomplished_04": "Anyone seen the portal? I don't want to end up buried too.",
	"pdr_level_nurgle_swift_river_03": "You'll not catch me in those waters. I'm not a strong swimmer.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_almost_there_01": "Ah, that's better. Can't stand the stench of a raki lair.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_almost_there_02": "Smell that? Good mountain air... if spoilt by death.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_almost_there_03": "Daylight, and about time too.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_almost_there_04": "There we go, dawri. I told you we'd get out.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_bardin_passing_one_01b": "#Oh how they tried, and how they failed, to break the dwarf, so dastardly jailed#",
	"pdr_level_prologue_chaos_01": "So we've northlanders too? This should be fun.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_chaos_02": "Kazaki'dum? What are they doing here?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_chaos_03": "Kruber, want to tell us why there are kazaki'dum after our hides?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_chaos_04": "Kazaki'dum too? The more the merrier, that's what I say.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_01": "Reckon that's our exit up ahead.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_02": "Is that the platform Aldrinn meant?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_03": "There's our lifting platform.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_04": "Hurry up, dawri. That's our lifting platform.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_rising_01": "The thaggoraki seem a bit worked up.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_rising_02": "It's like they don't want us to go.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_rising_03": "You're not catching us now, raki!",
	"pdr_level_prologue_elevator_rising_04": "Give up, raki! We're not coming back!",
	"pdr_level_prologue_fight_01": "Ah, raki! And I'm ready for a fight!",
	"pdr_level_prologue_fight_02": "Come on, wazzoks! I've indignities to repay with a good thumping!",
	"pdr_level_prologue_fight_03": "Don't expect any mercy today, raki!",
	"pdr_level_prologue_fight_04": "I warn you, raki. I haven't had an ale in weeks. Makes me... irritable.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_reached_surface_01b": "Are we seriously about to hop into some magic umgak expecting to come out in one piece?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_reached_surface_02b": "Fine. If I come out of the thing as the elf, I hold you all responsible.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_seeing_crater_01b": "I had heard of destruction on this scale before. Didn't believe it. Now I do.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_stock_up_01": "Don't be shy, dawri. Take all you can.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_stock_up_02": "No sense leaving out for the raki.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_stock_up_03": "If you need it, take it. That's my advice.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_stock_up_04": "Take whatever you can use, drengbarazi.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_supply_01": "A supply room, thank Valaya.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_supply_02": "That's a supply room, Or a plunder room.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_supply_03": "Raki have been busy looting, looks like.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_supply_04": "Look at all that in there. Ours for the taking.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_01": "So what is it the thaggoraki are up to, eh?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_02": "The raki are busy. They're always up to something.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_03": "Scheme all you like, raki. I'll see it stopped.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_04": "Busy kruti, aren't they?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_where_are_we_01": "So, any ideas where we are?",
	"pdr_level_prologue_where_are_we_02": "Don't recognise this place. 'Course, the raki haven't left much.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_where_are_we_03": "We're not out of trouble yet. Looks like the raki have levelled this place.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_where_are_we_04": "No help for us out here, dawri. We're on our own. As usual.",
	"pdr_level_prologue_wizard_down_b_02": "She's down, not out. We'll get her back on her feet.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_city_on_fire_01": "Raki umgak always good kindling, dawri. Just look at it burn.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_city_on_fire_02": "Always a pleasure seeing raki filth torched, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_01": "I can't abide these colours flying over Karak Gnol. Cut them down!",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_02": "Cut the flag down. Let's give Karak Gnol a few hours without them.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_03": "Kruting raki, flapping their flags above dawi stone. Cut it down!",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_04": "Filthy banner. Someone tear it down, and I'll buy you a drink.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_01": "Oi! Blocked! We need a new route to the forge.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_02": "No way through. We have to find another way to reach the forge, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_01": "Keep to tracks. dawri. They should see us to the forge.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_02": "Follow the tracks. dawri. They lead to the forge.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_01": "You hear that? Bunch of rakogri nearby.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_02": "I hear rakogri. Let's hope they don't hear us.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_03": "There are rakogri somewhere close.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_hearing_pens_04": "I'll be glad if those rakogri don't come any closer. The noise is enough for this dawi.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_lifting_device_moved_01": "Hohoho! Look at that! Those flames will definitely improve the place.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_lifting_device_moved_02": "Haha! A fortunate accident, won't you say?",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_01": "Eh, dawri, clear the way, will ya?",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_02": "Dawri, that umgak is barring our way.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_rat_ogre_rampage_03": "See them scatter! (laugh) Okri'd love this!",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_01": "Don't look at me. I was being all quiet and sneaky. Like an elgi.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_02": "I guess sneaking's out. It wasn't me that woke 'em up, mind you. I tread light as a feather.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eleven_01": "Aye, well... They're not suitable for a manling. Wouldn't be fair.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_one_01": "Aye, we have made something of a name for ourselves hereabouts.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_seven_01": "(growl)",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_seven_02": "About six hundred and thirty-two years, fifty seven days and five hours. Approximately speaking, of course.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_seven_03": "Aye, things got a little confused in the last moments.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_six_01": "Me, Zharrinn? I'm more of a troll expert, myself. And gobbos, of course.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_six_02": "Didn't say that. Raki get everywhere. But you don't need to know their flags to beat 'em to a pulp, do you?",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_ten_01": "My folk have other battles in hand. Always do.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_ten_02": "Did you not hear the elgi? Muttering about portents and dreams. There's only darkness ahead.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_ten_03": "Look around. Think on all we've seen. Little enough chance of that.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_three_01": "Boga! What was that name?",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_three_02": "Grimgi gave me the name of a raki clan to shout when we fight the warlord. I've forgotten it.",

	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_story_two_02": "I was going to say. Mork's a gobbo deity. Said to be cunning and brutal. Or brutal and cunning.",

	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_03": "Filthy raki, lording it over an honest hold like he owns the place.",
	"pdr_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_04": "That the warlord's nest? Just wait 'til I get up there.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_crates_01": "We need more warpstone. Might be some down there.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_crates_02": "Wish we didn't need warpstone, but as we do, might be worth checking that dock.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_crates_03": "What about those crates?",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_crates_04": "How about we search those crates? Not like they'll leave warpstone lying around in the snow.",

	"pdr_level_skittergate_encampment_03": "Lot of kazaki'dum in our path, but that won't stop us, eh?",

	"pdr_level_skittergate_follow_04": "Hold onto your boots, dawri. We're going through the portal.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_01": "Nothing changes. The kazaki'dum are always marching to war.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_02": "These ships'll keep coming south as long as the world lasts, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_03": "Those ships are only the first. Others'll come, drengbarazi.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_frozen_lake_04": "Looks like the prospect of plunder's spreading. New axes taking ship in search of glory.",

	"pdr_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_a_04": "I'll take pleasure in crushing your skull, raki!",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_rasknitt_reply_b_01": "No one toys with this dawi!",

	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_five_01": "You and me both, Azumgi. He's been lucky, that's all.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_five_02": "Then we'll kill him, and steal it back. It'll be a pleasure.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_nine_01": "Aye, one or two. We've lost most to the kazaki'dum, mind.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_nine_02": "Aye, well, there's a kind of madness in these parts. Not many of my kind want to risk it.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_ten_01": "Now that's a lot of kazaki'dum.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_ten_02": "What is it you know, wutelgi?",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_two_01": "A last fight, Azumgi? I'm not dying here. To come so far and fail? It'd be embarrassing.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_story_two_02": "Aye. Let's show these wazzoks what we're made of!",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_vast_camp_01": "Looks like the Rotblood's we've fought were barely a pebble in the scree, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_vast_camp_02": "That's a lot of kazaki'dum. Too many for us.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_vast_camp_03": "That's what's heading through the gate if we fail, dawri.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_vast_camp_04": "Look at those tents. The invasion's not long off, not now.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_01": "Pick up your feet, dawri. It's getting away.",

	"pdr_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_03": "Looks like we're going back up the hill.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_winchway_follow_04": "The warpstone's off. Us too!",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_winch_01": "Pile of umgak, but it should get the warpstone where it's needed.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_winch_02": "Look at this mess. Let's hope it holds together long enough to convey the warpstone.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_winch_03": "This winch-way's a pile of umgak, but it beats hauling warpstone around by hand.",
	"pdr_level_skittergate_winch_04": "I'll be glad not to haul that warpstone around. We'll risk the winch-way.",
	"pdr_level_ussingen_cart_idea_01": "A cart? That gives me an idea. One that calls for black powder.",
	"pdr_level_ussingen_cart_idea_02": "So, I wonder about that cart. And some black powder.",
	"pdr_level_ussingen_cart_idea_03": "Oho! How about we fill that cart with something merry, like black powder?",
	"pdr_level_ussingen_cart_idea_04": "That cart's just what we need. Find me black powder, and we'll have a bonfire.",
	"pdr_level_ussingen_cart_torch_01": "Won't light itself, dawri. Look for a torch.",
	"pdr_level_ussingen_cart_torch_02": "We need a brand, or a tinderbox. Or...",

	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_b_02": "The crone wanted a look at the Skittergate. Easier if the Skaven are looking at us.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_c_01": "Keeps her away from me, at least.",
	"pes_helmgart_military_mid_c_02": "Maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe the ratmen'll kill her.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_a_01": "I see Okri wants us to clobber something. Again.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_a_02": "Hmmm. Okri's got another of these grudgemarks for us to settle.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_b_01": "Long as he's paying, what's the harm?",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_b_02": "It's a laugh, ain't it? May as well do something to pass the time.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_c_01": "Okri might have sweetened the deal with some dwarfen ale.",
	"pes_hub_grudgemark_c_02": "Too much to ask that Okri lends a hand, I suppose.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_kn_one_02": "Ah, knock it off Lohner. Just cause I was tapped on me shoulders with a sword, by Saltzpyre of all people, I'm not changing who I am over night. Bloody good gear though. Can't complain about that.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_kn_three_02": "No! You shall not. And you don't need to be 'sir'-ing me all the time either. And yeah, sounds like you're more interested in finding this old Grandmaster than I am.",
	"pes_hub_lohner_conversation_kn_two_02": "Mhh. Apparently, no survivors except for a geriatric old grandmaster somewhere. Poor sods. Never had the chance to meet a single one of them.",
	"pes_hub_olesya_conversation_twentyfive_01": "Same as most days, I'd have thought, Madame Pimenova.",

	"pes_level_bell_destroy_bell_02": "Bell in sight. Commence mayhem and destruction, mates.",
	"pes_level_bell_destroy_bell_03": "Break the chains!",

	"pes_level_bell_distance_02": "There it is. Looks like a long bloody way off.",
	"pes_level_bell_distance_03": "Who put that bell all the way over there?",
	"pes_level_bell_effect_03": "Awful sounds for awful rats. Awful frenzied rats too. The bell does it for 'em.",

	"pes_level_bell_falling_03": "Now - that - is leaving a mark and making an impression, mates! Worth the march, definitely!",
	"pes_level_bell_falling_04": "Bell's down. Now, if it'd only stop making that racket!",
	"pes_level_bell_horde_03": "Shutting that bell up will definitely mean less vermin hordes. Figure some of you may find that a bit boring.",
	"pes_level_bell_horde_04": "So... Many... Rats... Kill 'em all!",
	"pes_level_bell_long_stairs_01": "Stairs. Oh good.",
	"pes_level_bell_long_stairs_02": "Why are there always stairs?",
	"pes_level_bell_long_stairs_03": "One step at a time, mates. Soon be there.",
	"pes_level_bell_poor_quarters_01": "I've had billets like this, and hated every minute.",
	"pes_level_bell_poor_quarters_02": "No fun, living down in the pauper's yards.",
	"pes_level_bell_poor_quarters_03": "No place to live. It's a gamble if the plague gets you before you fetch a knife in the ribs.",
	"pes_level_bell_rain_01": "More rain. Still, not as bad as Stromdorf.",
	"pes_level_bell_rain_02": "Rain? Refreshing? Fine, I like being dry more.",
	"pes_level_bell_reaching_bell_01": "At last! Now, let's do something about that bell. Something it won't like at all.",
	"pes_level_bell_reaching_bell_02": "Hello, bell. We're the last band of mates you ever want to see.",
	"pes_level_bell_reaching_bell_03": "Alright, We've come a long way and I'm not leaving without making a mark. We usually do though, so no worries.",
	"pes_level_bell_rich_quarters_01": "Just think, a month back they'd have shoo'd our kind out of these streets. Well, my kind at least.",
	"pes_level_bell_rich_quarters_02": "Now, this is more like it. Windows. Servants. Drains.",
	"pes_level_bell_rich_quarters_03": "Always wanted to afford a little abode like one of these. And only afford. Not a city-dweller, me.",
	"pes_level_bell_rich_quarters_knight_04": "Just think, a month back they'd have shoo'd our kind out of these streets. Well, before the whole Knight thing, anyway.",
	"pes_level_bell_rooftops_01": "Over the rooftops? Can't say I care for it. In fact, been a bit much.",
	"pes_level_bell_rooftops_02": "The rooftops. Always with the bloody up and down.",
	"pes_level_bell_rooftops_03": "That beam just moved, sweat on Taal's horns it did.",
	"pes_level_bell_spotting_01": "There's the bell. Getting closer all the time.",
	"pes_level_bell_spotting_02": "Nearly there. Spirits up, mates.",
	"pes_level_bell_spotting_03": "Smartly now! The bell's in sight.",

	"pes_level_bell_vista_02": "Climbed a long way, haven't we?",
	"pes_level_bogenhafen_city_sanctum_03": "Eyes open for hidden doors, mates. The sanctum's near.",

	"pes_level_catacombs_shield_of_flies_01": "We can't get through those flies!",
	"pes_level_catacombs_shield_of_flies_02": "Taal! The flies get in the way!",
	"pes_level_catacombs_shield_of_flies_03": "A shield of flies? Impenetrable, too.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_shield_of_flies_04": "Don't waste your time shooting. We need to try something else.",

	"pes_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_02": "Looks like we have our breach point.",
	"pes_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_03": "I see a tunnel!",
	"pes_level_catacombs_tunnel_entrance_04": "Looks like we've a tunnel to follow.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_01": "Yeah. They're not pleased, are they?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_02": "Thought they were supposed to be fighting each other?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_03": "Taal! What'll it take to get them smacking each other about?",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_fight_themselves_04": "They ain't squabbling!",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_01": "Yeah, this looks like an ambush waiting to happen.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_02": "Plenty of ambush potential amongst those shacks.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_03": "They're waiting up ahead. Meet 'em with steel.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_ghost_town_04": "Have a care, mates. This looks like an ambush.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_01": "We're getting closer. Keep your eyes peeled.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_02": "Look at this! No order to these tents. And they call 'emselves an army.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_03": "We're on the camp's fringes. Keep going.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_islands_04": "This isn't a camp, it's a sprawl. No discipline. None at all.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_01": "No point in watchtowers without guards and sentries.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_02": "That watchtower makes 'em look like soldiers, but they ain't.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_03": "Keep an eye on that tower. Might be more up there.",
	"pes_level_chaos_war_camp_watchtower_04": "Look at that watchtower. What a mess!",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_01": "Don't stray too far! We don't want to get overwhelmed!",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_02": "How much further? This place is enormous.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_03": "They're gonna keep coming. We'll have to keep moving.",
	"pes_level_elven_ruins_proper_04": "Don't tire now, mates. These ruins can't go on forever.",
	"pes_level_fort_and_again_01": "A good hit, but we need another.",
	"pes_level_fort_and_again_02": "That hurt it. Another'll finish it.",
	"pes_level_fort_and_again_03": "Good shot! But we'll want one more.",
	"pes_level_fort_and_again_04": "A good start. Let's finish it!",
	"pes_level_fort_barrel_fouled_01": "Barrel's fouled. Check the other one.",
	"pes_level_fort_barrel_fouled_02": "This barrel's had it. What of the other?",
	"pes_level_fort_barrel_fouled_03": "No more shots from this one, mates. Try the other.",
	"pes_level_fort_barrel_fouled_04": "Taal! Blacker than sin, and just as crusty. We'll try the other.",
	"pes_level_fort_cannonballs_03": "We're out of cannonballs. Anyone see any?",
	"pes_level_fort_cannons_silenced_01": "The cannons stopped firing. Not good!",
	"pes_level_fort_cannons_silenced_02": "Blast, the cannons have stopped! Double time!",
	"pes_level_fort_cannons_silenced_03": "Faster, mates! Silent cannons isn't good news.",
	"pes_level_fort_cannons_silenced_04": "Faster, mates! Silent cannons means there's trouble coming.",
	"pes_level_fort_carriage_03": "Hop over the carriage.",
	"pes_level_fort_carriage_04": "Hop over the carriage.",
	"pes_level_fort_clear_courtyard_01": "The northlanders remain though, Better mop this up, mates.",
	"pes_level_fort_clear_courtyard_02": "With less rats, more time for the northlanders - who don't know when to leave.",
	"pes_level_fort_clear_courtyard_03": "No more rats, just cornered northlanders. Have at them, mates!",
	"pes_level_fort_clear_courtyard_04": "Good work mates. Now secure the courtyard.",
	"pes_level_fort_complete_01": "Nicely done, mates. Reckon we've earned a drink or two.",
	"pes_level_fort_complete_02": "Not my first siege, but this one ended better than most.",
	"pes_level_fort_complete_03": "Brachsenbrücke will fight another day. We did alright, didn't we?",
	"pes_level_fort_complete_04": "Don't mind the role of a hero now and then. Gives a man a sense of pride.",
	"pes_level_fort_confirmation_01": "Right you are sir!",
	"pes_level_fort_confirmation_02": "Right, you heard the man!",
	"pes_level_fort_confirmation_03": "You can depend on us!",

	"pes_level_fort_cross_here_04": "That's our crossing? Taal's tears.",
	"pes_level_fort_fire_01": "Fire!",
	"pes_level_fort_fire_02": "Light the touchpaper!",
	"pes_level_fort_fire_03": "Lay the sights, and let 'er roar!",

	"pes_level_fort_fire_cannon_second_03": "I knew they had more catapults, just didn't think they'd be stupid enough to present it like that.",

	"pes_level_fort_gate_fallen_03": "The gate's down! Pick up your feet! Now!",

	"pes_level_fort_get_back_on_road_02": "The road's calling me. I want stone under my boots again.",

	"pes_level_fort_get_back_on_road_04": "Is the road clear? Looks clear to me.",
	"pes_level_fort_jump_down_01": "Typical. Find a good road, have to leave it. Just my luck.",
	"pes_level_fort_jump_down_02": "Guess we're leaving the road behind, then.",
	"pes_level_fort_jump_down_03": "Yeah. We're not getting further on this road, are we?",
	"pes_level_fort_jump_down_04": "We'll have to go around, and hope there's a way through.",

	"pes_level_fort_powder_and_shot_01": "Right. Powder and shot, coming right up.",
	"pes_level_fort_powder_and_shot_02": "We need powder, and a bit of shot too.",
	"pes_level_fort_powder_and_shot_03": "So, anyone see any ammunition for this beast?",
	"pes_level_fort_powder_and_shot_04": "Can't fire without powder and shot.",
	"pes_level_fort_push_them_back_01": "The Outer Courtyard, mates! Either we take it, or we don't win. Pretty easy.",
	"pes_level_fort_push_them_back_02": "This only ends well if we take the Outer Courtyard! Push them back, mates! Go!",
	"pes_level_fort_push_them_back_03": "We'll have to carve our way to the Outer Courtyard, mates. Fort will never hold as it is.",

	"pes_level_fort_spotting_portal_02": "Back home, mates? I see the portal.",
	"pes_level_fort_spotting_portal_03": "There's the portal. Not much of a walk this time.",
	"pes_level_fort_spotting_portal_04": "Ah, the portal. Come to save my weary legs.",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_01": "Thank Sigmar! We've found it! But so have they...",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_02": "This is the way, mates. Has to be. I don't like the look of that gate...",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_03": "Up this way mates, but hurry. The gate's smashed in.",
	"pes_level_fort_this_is_it_04": "That's what we've been looking for! Seems the enemy found it first.",
	"pes_level_fort_under_attack_03": "If the cannons stop, the fort ain't gonna hold much longer.",

	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_mid_fight_03": "Just keep bringing it, mates! We have that dung-neck just where we want him! He's not wobbling his way out of this one!",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_boss_taunt_reply_03": "Well, all I have to say to that, you rambling git, is the Sea of Claws is missing one of its blubbery whales. I just caught it. Soon have it gutted, too.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_complete_03": "By Taal, we got him! He had it coming, a long time coming, but yeah, we got him good.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_complete_04": "Hah! Lost a tree, northlanders? Shame.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_draw_bridge_01": "Slice those ropes, mates. We need the bridge down.",

	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_03": "It has to die, which means we have to find a way to kill it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_destroy_04": "Should've brought an axe. A nice, big, flaming axe.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_01": "Right, how about this? Black powder, shoved right down its gullet.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_feed_explosives_02": "Explosives. That's what we need.",

	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_02": "Disgusting! Let's get rid of it.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_03": "There's a way to kill it. Got to be.",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_response_04": "So, how do we kill it?",
	"pes_level_ground_zero_growth_sever_the_vines_01": "Cut your way through!",

	"pes_level_prologue_skaven_works_02": "Looks like the ratmen have been up to something, and it ain't small.",
	"pes_level_prologue_skaven_works_03": "Skaven have been busy. Whatever they've been up to, can't be good.",
	"pes_level_prologue_skaven_works_04": "That machine don't look finished, but it's only a matter of time! If only I were out of this cage!",

	"pes_level_prologue_stock_up_01": "Might as well stock up. Who knows what's ahead?",
	"pes_level_prologue_stock_up_02": "Grab whatever you need. No sense leaving stuff for the vermin.",

	"pes_level_prologue_there_they_are_01": "That's them, up ahead! We've found 'em!",
	"pes_level_prologue_there_they_are_02": "There they are. Don't worry mates, I'll soon have you out of there!",

	"pes_level_prologue_there_they_are_04": "Thank Sigmar! They're still alive!",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_kerillian_01": "Taking a nap, elf? There's work to be done.",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_kerillian_02": "Come on, elf. Where's the hardiness of the elder races now?",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_kerillian_03": "Hurry up, Kerillian, or I'll leave you here.",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_kerillian_04": "Still got a bit of fight in you, Kerillian?",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_sienna_01": "Don't fret, Sienna. Soon have you up.",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_sienna_02": "Nice and easy, Sienna. Soon have you free.",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_sienna_03": "You ready to give the vermin a bit o' flame, Sienna?",
	"pes_level_prologue_up_sienna_04": "Glad to see you're still with us, Sienna.",
	"pes_level_prologue_weapons_01": "Now that is better. Feeling much more like my old self.",
	"pes_level_prologue_weapons_02": "Now ain'tcha a beautiful one? You and me, we're gonna cause us some trouble!",
	"pes_level_prologue_weapons_03": "Ha! Time for a bit of payback!",
	"pes_level_prologue_weapons_04": "That's what I needed. Now to crack some skaven skulls!",
	"pes_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_01": "The ratmen are up to something. Didn't hear much. Something about a pact.",
	"pes_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_02": "The skaven have got a plan, mates. And allies too.",
	"pes_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_03": "Proper vermin, these ratmen. Can't keep 'em down, more's the pity.",
	"pes_level_prologue_what_are_they_up_to_04": "The ratmen have a plan, but I don't think us escaping was part of it.",
	"pes_level_prologue_where_are_we_01": "So, does anyone have the first idea where we are?",
	"pes_level_prologue_where_are_we_02": "Don't recognise the place. 'Course, with all that fog...",
	"pes_level_prologue_where_are_we_03": "Where are we? Taal, but I don't even know how long we were down there.",
	"pes_level_prologue_where_are_we_04": "Could be anywhere in the Empire. Not that it matters right now.",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_02": "Let's bring the banner down. It's bound to make the ratmen furious.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_03": "Here, let's pull that banner down. That'll rile 'em up for sure.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_destroy_banner_04": "Give me a hand, mates. We'll pull the banner down.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_01": "Mind if we take the lift? I reckon it might just hold together.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_02": "That lifting platform looks functional - barely.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_03": "This'll take us upwards. I hope.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_elevator_04": "Going up? By the look of it, that's a chancy bet.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_01": "Dead end here, mates. We'll have to swing around to reach the forge.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_find_another_way_to_foundry_02": "No way following those tracks. We better find some other way to the forge.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_01": "Alright, here's the tracks. Should lead us to the foundry.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_follow_tracks_02": "Tracks. Just follow 'em, like Lohner said.",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_01": "Oi! Somebody that junk out of the way!",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_move_lifting_device_02": "Rat-city's on fire. Bloody brilliant.",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_01": "So, the sneaky approach? I think we can forget about that, folks.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_so_much_for_stealth_02": "I guess the quiet approach is off. Hey, I never said I'd be any good at sneaking, did I?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eight_01": "Dwarfs are clever folk. Think what their machines could do for the Empire.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eight_02": "Seems a bit cautious, if you ask me.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eleven_01": "Don't suppose the armoury's still intact? I wouldn't mind a dwarf-forged handgun.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_eleven_02": "On me?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_five_01": "Are there many Skaven clans, sir?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_five_02": "That's a pleasant thought.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_three_01": "What're you grumbling about, Bardin?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_three_02": "Well, just make something up. Skaven are paranoid. They'll believe anything.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_twelve_01": "So here's a thing... Shouldn't we try to get the Skaven and the northlanders at each others' throats too?",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_twelve_02": "Aye, wouldn't be surprised if he did. Not anymore.",
	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_story_victor_one_01": "Sir, the Skaven Warlord, seems you had a bit of history with him. If you don't mind me asking?",

	"pes_level_skaven_stronghold_warlord_nest_distance_04": "Over there! That looks like the nest we want.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_01": "Just a thought, but what if those crates are warpstone shipments?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_02": "Could be some warpstone in those crates.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_03": "Maybe the northlanders are supplying the warpstone? If so, there might be some at the docks.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_crates_04": "We may as well die searching for more warpstone. Let's start with the dockside.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_01": "Good riddance.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_02": "Oh, but I enjoyed that.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_03": "That's my folks avenged. Took too damn long.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_dead_seer_04": "Next time you kill a Kruber, make sure you kill 'em all.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_01": "Yeah... Now we're here, I'm not rightly sure we can touch that thing.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_02": "We should've thought this through a bit more.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_03": "We might've bitten off too much this time. How d'we destroy that thing?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_destroy_04": "Call me simple, but I'd thought there'd be something we can smash.",
	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_01": "Don't suppose that camp's empty?",
	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_02": "Of course there's an army in the way.",

	"pes_level_skittergate_encampment_04": "No matter what happens, we stick together, and keep fighting. Agreed?",

	"pwe_level_farmlands_portal_04": "The portal opens. Perhaps Olesya can deliver us into the benighted town. Wouldn't that be fun, mayflies?",
