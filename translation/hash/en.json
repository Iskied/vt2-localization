You remember how I’ve commissioned a local lass to immortalise your deeds? ����No?����Well, then you should pay more attention, shouldn’t you?����Anyway, this lass – name of Catrinne – she’s on her way up to the keep, when she’s jumped by a pack of skaven. Don’t worry, she’s alright. Thing about skirts is they’re good for hiding knives, and Catrinne’s got as many knives as she has paintbrushes.����Thing is, she took something strange off one of the corpses. A trinket of dwarfen make, by the looks of things – a lodestone. Catrinne gave it to me, Olesya nicked it out of my quarters… and, well, she thinks it’s important. ����I told her that you found it, by the way. She doesn’t much like Catrinne.����Cutting to the chase, Olesya says it’s got something to do with Ubersreik. With me so far, or have you forgotten that as well? Good. She doesn’t know what, of course. Only that there are three dwarfen runes hidden about the place that serve as the key to its hiding place.����Now, we can’t very well go back to Ubersreik. Even if we weren’t up to our eyes in it over here, half of the place is in ruins by now. Could be our runes have gone to wherever it is runes go when they die. But Olesya has a plan.����I know, terrifying, right? Olesya with a plan’s a bit like one of those skaven mining machines. It’ll get you where you want to go, but one false move and you’ll not whistle a jaunty tune ever again.����Olesya reckons she can craft an illusion of Ubersreik as it was just as things started to go south. Once you’re inside, you can have a dig around for these runes – maybe even get an idea of what the bloody things are for. ����Only catch is, once you’re inside the illusion, you won’t remember having been there before. Olesya swears it’s necessary. I think she’s just being a malevolent old baggage, but she’s the wizard. I just stand here nattering about the weather, or so she says.����But it’s not all bad. Olesya will guide you while you’re in the illusion, and it’s not like you’ll forget how to kill the ratmen, is it?����Let’s hope not.����Back to Ubersreik with you!","3909BFE8":"Hear that?

On the other hand, life-expectancy is seldom better in confined spaces if a troll is present, and to be an ironbreaker is to make selfless decisions for the good of the hold.

While it is accorded a great honour to have a priestess attend the birth of a child or the coronation of a monarch, there is always a lingering suspicion as to what exactly the significance of her gifts – and her words – might hold.��No such doubts are present, however, if a priestess of Lileath deigns to join a battle line. There is only the certainty that the struggle to come is somehow pivotal in the elven race’s long battle for survival.

It’s also surprisingly odorous, possessing a fishy stench that can curdle milk from several dozen yards upwind. ��Curiously, immersion in water only makes the smell worse, as Kruber discovered when taking a swim in the River Bögen (for entirely mischievous purposes). Alas, forewarned – and not a little sickened – by the stench, the villagers fled for the safety of upwind climes, making the prank fall a little flat. All might have been well had that same aroma not lured a river troll out of its waterside cave, leading to the weaponless Kruber’s hasty and ignominious retreat. To add insult to injury, Sienna and Kerillian have since immortalised events in a brief but poignant romantic play, whose performance has been wholeheartedly embraced by the Bögen fisherfolk.��","B018ACDF":"We've got a fine blaze going there, people.","B01CF8A6":"Oh, you make my heart beat faster, sergeant.

Likewise, night seldom falls in this part of the forest and, even when it does, the hours of darkness are few and fleeting. ����The Elves of this realm are generous, and given to holding lavish feasts at the slightest provocation. They are also, unlike many of Athel Loren’s denizens, welcoming to peaceable outsiders, and waste no time including interlopers in the festivities. Many such ‘guests’ are resistant at first, but the first mouthful of sprigwine swiftly overcomes most resistance.����So it is that many outsiders have bided for long centuries in the glades of the Summerstrand, eating, drinking, making merry and seldom marking the passage of time. Few notice that their Elven feast-partners change as the hours and days pass, or that their hosts are more measured in the sampling of delights. ����Even fewer notice when their fellow guests, insensate with indolence, are carried from the feast by silent Dryad attendants. These glutted creatures are left at the entrance to the Vaults of Winter. Those ancient caverns are the work of a civilisation older than the Elves, and are home to beings that feast on reeking and pleasure-sodden souls. ����Thus do the guests of Arranoc pass from this world, sacrificed to sate creatures that would otherwise prey on the Elves of the Summerstrand.","CBA10FBA":"Aha!

Its previous owner, a fellow Ostland Swordsman, was fortunately wise enough to clearly mark the helmet with Imperial insignia to avoid being mistaken for the enemy on the battlefield. ����Pirazzo's Lost Legion shot to fame as the only survivors of the Lustrian expedition funded by the merchants of Tobaro. The ill-fated expedition ran into trouble as soon as the mercenary regiments had landed on the shores of Lustria. The sailors of the ships, who were also mercenaries, weighed anchor and abandoned the soldiers, taking the pay chests of the three regiments with them. Of course, as a precaution against an opposed landing, the pay chests had been left to last! ����Pirazzo was the only commander to advise against leaving the pay chests behind and the mercenaries now realized that he was by far the best leader and the other regiments mutinied. Their incompetent and unfortunate captains were cast adrift and the remaining men joined together as a single regiment under Pirazzo’s command, calling themselves the ‘Lost Legion’. ����The Lost Legion, thirsty for the riches hidden in the jungle, embarked on a series of grand adventures and battles. First they clashed against the Skinks and Lizardmen, until a pragmatic Slann Mage priest used both magic and payment in treasure to turn the Lost Legion's pikes and crossbows towards the undead of the Vampire Coast. Victorious, Pirazzo's mercenaries assembled a fleet and crossed the ocean. They landed in Araby and then fought their way through Sartosa to finally arrive in Tilea.","D76F4718":"We've still got northlanders to kill!","D773C6A6":"Want the wind gone?

This is a calling that comes from within, for there is little glory in the darkness, and few will ever know the mighty deeds performed within its grasp. ��Indeed, ironbreakers perhaps best represent Valaya’s calling of ‘peace through war’ than any other cadre of dwarfs. Where their kin might fight for glory, for wealth or in the prosecution of old grudges, ironbreakers hold hearth and home precious above all.
